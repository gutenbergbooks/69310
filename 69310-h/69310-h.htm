<h2 class="nobreak" id="PROLOGUE">PROLOGUE</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">When</span> the Delancey affair had been brought
to a conclusion, it was not uninteresting to note
the various opinions set forth regarding its happy
termination.</p>

<p>Biddy, at once autocrat and indulger of at
least three generations of juvenile Delanceys,
maintained, and stoutly, it was entirely due to
her own prayers to her patron saint. She took,
so to speak, a monopoly of the business as far as
any human agency was concerned. But, as one
cannot, with any degree of modesty, parade one’s
private devotions to the world at large, it was
hardly probable that this view of the matter would
be universal.</p>

<p>The village in general, with the exception of
Mrs. Trimwell, laid the whole credit at the feet of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>Lady Mary Delancey. Doubtless this was on
account of the wave of relief which had surged
over it, and which exalted her ladyship, for the
time being at least, to a pinnacle of almost giddy
height.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell had her own private views on the
matter. What they were, will, no doubt, be
realized later.</p>

<p>Corin Elmore believed the whole thing due to
karma, though it is true that this particular
arrangement of karma puzzled him not a little.</p>

<p>John Mortimer, while maintaining on the whole
a strictly neutral attitude, allowed his opinion
of the credit due to sway slightly, if it swayed at
all, in the direction of his sister Elizabeth. And
in so doing, he swayed nearer the mark, if you will
believe me, than the majority of folk with opinions
on the subject.</p>

<p>Father Maloney was heard to announce that
“surely to goodness the fella himself might be
allowed a taste of the credit.” The “fella” was
David Delancey. But more of him anon. Father
Maloney made the announcement with a twinkle
in his eye, and a slight exchange of glances with
Lady Mary. That exchange of glances puzzled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>more than one of those who had happened to
surprise it. Its meaning, however, was never
fathomed. There was no question but that
Lady Mary and the priest were past masters in
keeping their own counsel when they chose.
He would be a bold man who put any question
savouring of impertinence to Lady Mary. For
my part, I had sooner face a whole battery of
artillery than have Lady Mary’s tortoiseshell-rimmed
lorgnettes turned slowly upon me, her
grey eyes glinting through them with steely
courtesy. The courtesy was never absent, you may
be sure, but then neither&mdash;on occasions&mdash;was
the steeliness. Nor would it be well, if you wished
to retain the smallest atom of self-respect, to
question Father Maloney unduly. That soft
tongue and speech of his could shrivel your complacency
to the likeness of a withered leaf when
you deserved it. And you may be very sure
that, when they did shrivel it, you were left in
no manner of doubt as to your deserts in the
matter.</p>

<p>Lady Mary herself never ventured the smallest
hint of an opinion as to whom the credit was due.
In fact from first to last she kept a dignified
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>silence on the whole affair, save when sheer
necessity demanded speech from her. Her silence
and dignity alone prevented it from sinking to
melodrama, and truth obliges me to confess that
it had more than once a distinctly suspicious
flavour of that obnoxious quality.</p>

<p>But this is beginning at the wrong end of the
skein, a proceeding which will indubitably result
in a most fearsome tangle. Therefore, with your
permission, I will break off and start anew.</p>

<span class="smaller">CONCERNING THE VILLAGE OF MALFORD</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent">“<span class="smcap">Your</span> idea,” said John meditatively, “as
far as I can elucidate it from your somewhat
wordy discourse, is that I should accompany
you to this exceedingly out-of-the-way, this on
your own showing entirely remote, secluded, and
sequestered spot, for the sole purpose of affording
you amusement in your so to speak out of work
hours.”</p>

<p>“That,” returned Corin admiringly, “is the
idea <i>in toto</i>. It is marvellous with what ease
and skill you have grasped and summed up
the entire situation.”</p>

<p>John sighed.</p>

<p>“And might one be allowed to question what
are the advantages to be gained from such a
sojourn? What manner of recreation can the
place afford? In a word, where do I come in?”</p>

<p>“Advantages!” Corin raised his eyes to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>cobwebby rafters. “Heavens above! Isn’t my
companionship an advantage? And for recreation
what more can you desire than the contemplation
of country lanes and wide moorland this
glorious summer weather? Think of it, man!
The earth ablaze with purple heather, the sea
blue and golden,&mdash;breathing, living, colour. Anon
there will be blackberries, great luscious clusters
of blue-black fruit hanging ready for the plucking
in every hedgerow. Again, I ask, what more
can you desire?”</p>

<p>John smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“I am not, I would have you observe, either
an artist or a boy. Your inducements fail to
move me.”</p>

<p>“My companionship,” urged Corin.</p>

<p>“The blatant conceit of the man,” sighed John.</p>

<p>Corin changed his tone, descended to wheedling.
“Consider my loneliness,” he remarked pathetically.
“From six o’clock&mdash;I can’t put in more
than an eight-hour day&mdash;till midnight alone and
unoccupied. Six hours!”</p>

<p>“Go to bed at nine and reduce the six hours
by a simple process of subtraction to three, or
play patience,” returned John unsympathetically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>“Inhuman brute,” mourned Corin.</p>

<p>John merely laughed.</p>

<p>He was a tall young man, thirty or thereabouts,
clean-shaven, bronzed, grey-eyed, and with a thin
hooked nose. His mouth, below it, was slightly
grim in repose. But, when he smiled, you forgot
the grimness, and smiled involuntarily in response.
Also, you found yourself watching for the smile
to come into play a second time. It had a curious
manner of leaping first to his eyes in a sudden
and illuminating flash. Deserting them, it passed
equally suddenly to his mouth, leaving the eyes
sad. It was a disconcerting trick, a baffling
magician’s trick, and left you wondering. In
the matter of dress he was fastidious to a degree.
At the moment his attire was the most immaculate
suit of London clothes, grey trousers, frock coat,
and all the rest of the paraphernalia. His silk
hat, exceeding glossy, reposed on a worm-eaten
oak chair near him. He had removed a pile
of sketch books and a bunch of dilapidated lilies
to make place for the hat. They lay now on the
floor.</p>

<p>With Corin, by contrast, clothes were a matter
of necessity as mere covering, and no more. His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>tweed trousers and Norfolk jacket had an out-all-night-in-the-wet-and-then-sat-upon
air. In two
words they looked loosely crumpled. Paint spots
adorned the left sleeve, in the crook of the elbow
where his palette was wont to rest. His soft
collar, attached to his shirt, was unbuttoned, and
merely held together by a smoke-grey tie. Briefly,
in the matter of clothes, he was the prototype of
the modern novelist’s art-student,&mdash;the type that
emerges paint-stained, careless-clad, cheerfully
Bohemian, from the chapters of such novels as
deal with the art world in Chelsea.</p>

<p>But here it behoves me to walk warily lest I
should hear a whisper of “glass houses,” for does
not this very Corin himself dwell in that most
fascinating region of London? Is not his studio
within a bare five minutes of the dirty, muddy,
grey, but wholly adorable Thames, where it drifts
past Carlyle’s statue, smoke-grimed and weather-worn,
and on past the old herbalist’s garden set
back across the street?</p>

<p>In face, this same Corin was plump, smooth-skinned,
rosy-cheeked, fair-haired, with short-sighted
blue eyes that gazed at you kindly
from behind gold-rimmed spectacles. His own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>appearance caused him moments of acute anguish.</p>

<p>“Look at me!” he would cry on occasions,
having met his reflection in some unexpected
mirror in a friend’s house or studio, “Look at
me! The soul of an artist, and the appearance
of a benign and grown-up baby! If I didn’t
know my own nature and character, I vow I’d
be taken in. I <i>am</i> taken in when I come upon
myself in this disgusting and unexpected fashion.
Who’s that odd, kindly, little pink-faced man?
I ask myself. And then I realize it’s me, <i>me</i>,
<span class="allsmcap">ME</span>! And, even while I’m swearing at the sight
of myself, I look no more than a cross baby yelling
for its feeding bottle. Talk of purgatory! I get
ten years of it every time I come opposite a
looking-glass. The things ought to be abolished.
They ought to be ground to powder, scattered
like dust to the four winds of heaven. They
merely pander to woman’s vanity. No man
wants to look into one. If he looks like a man he
doesn’t bother about it. If he looks like me&mdash;”
At this juncture his anguish would become too
acute for further speech.</p>

<p>There was a pause in the conversation, quite an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>appreciable pause, seeing that it lasted at least
two and three-quarter minutes. Then:</p>

<p>“So the matter is definitely settled,” announced
Corin with an air of finality, “and on Tuesday next
you and I, a couple of boon companions, wend
our way to the charming, the altogether adorable
and old-world village of Malford, situated, so the
guide-books tell us, precisely seven miles from
Whortley station, as the crow flies. Why as the
crow flies,” he continued ruminatively, “I have
never been able to fathom. The information is
of remarkably small use to the feathered species,
and I have not yet been able to grasp what precise
and particular use it is to mankind at large.”</p>

<p>John, whose attention had been wandering,
roused himself.</p>

<p>“For sheer pertinacity,” he remarked suavely,
“commend me to one, Corin Elmore, painter,
poet, musician, theosophist, and fortune-teller; in
short, dabbler in the arts and the occult sciences.”</p>

<p>“At all events <i>you</i> can hear Mass at Malford,”
retorted Corin succinctly. It would appear that
“dabbler in the occult sciences” had pricked.</p>

<p>“Truly?” John’s tone was politely interrogative.
“At what distance from Malford, as the crow flies?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“You can hear Mass <i>in</i> Malford, <i>in</i> the Chapel,
<i>in</i> Delancey Castle.” The statement was
triumphant.</p>

<p>“Delancey Castle!” ejaculated John. For the
first time interest, genuine interest, stirred in his
voice. He began, in a manner of speaking, to
sit up and take notice.</p>

<p>“Delancey Castle,” reiterated Corin. And
then suspiciously, “But why this sudden interest?”</p>

<p>“Merely that I have heard of the place,” said
John nonchalantly.</p>

<p>“Who hasn’t?” Corin’s voice was faintly
edged with scorn. “One of the oldest baronial
castles in England; situated in a park famed for
its oaks and copper beeches; Norman in origin,
enlarged during the Tudor period; minstrel’s
gallery, secret chambers, terraced gardens. From
all accounts it breathes the very essence of romance
and bygone forgotten days. Heavens
above! were there indeed tongues in trees, and
sermons in stones, I’ll swear there’s many a tale
those old walls and the trees around them might
disclose.”</p>

<p>“It is a matter for devout thanks,” returned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>John piously, “that the tongue of Nature wags, in
a manner of speaking, rather in accordance with
our mood of the moment than by any actual
physical volition of its own. We have quite
enough to do to stop our ears to the human
tongues around us. But, seriously, I had no
idea that Delancey Castle was situated in this
sequestered spot of yours.”</p>

<p>“Sequestered spot of mine!” ejaculated Corin.
“I lay no claim to the spot. It exists not for
my benefit, save in so far, I would have you note,
as certain pecuniary advantages will accrue to
me for work done in its lonely regions. Nevertheless
Delancey Castle is situated there, unless
some good or evil genius has seen fit to remove
it piecemeal since last Thursday week. I saw
it on that date with my own eyes, ‘set on an
eminence’&mdash;again the guide-books&mdash;‘above the
small village of Malford. Glimpses of its rugged
grey towers may be observed among the lordly
oaks and magnificent copper beeches for which
the park is justly famed.’ I refer you to page
one hundred and twenty-two of Sanderson’s
<i>Guide to Country Houses</i> for the accuracy of my
quotation.” He broke off to light a fresh cigarette,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>then looked at John, challenging him through his
gold-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll not question the accuracy of your
quotation,” retorted John. “But how about
your <i>former</i> statement regarding the situation
of the Castle? You stated it was <i>in</i> the village.
Now I learn it is on an eminence above it.”</p>

<p>“Hark to the quibbler!” cried Corin.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” returned John. “A Castle <i>on</i>
an eminence is a very different pair of shoes from
a Castle <i>in</i> a village, especially when it is incumbent
upon one to seek that said Castle in order
to fulfil one’s devotional obligations.”</p>

<p>“If,” said Corin reflectively, “I were a Catholic&mdash;don’t
get excited, there’s no smallest prospect of
your ever claiming me as a convert&mdash;but if I were a
Catholic, I should not be so disgustingly slack about
my religion as to object to walking up a small
hill in order to attend my religious services.”</p>

<p>“I never said I objected to walking up a small
hill,” remarked John. “I was merely pointing
out the inaccuracy of your former statement.”</p>

<p>Corin sighed patiently. “You make me tired
with your quibbling. And that last remark
distinctly wanders from the truth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>John smiled, not deigning further reply. It
began as a small pitying smile for Corin’s weakness
of retort, it continued with a hint of pleasure, a
tiny secret excitement as at the possibility of the
fulfilment of some concealed desire. His heart
had beaten at least three degrees quicker at the
mention of Delancey Castle, and it had not yet
resumed its normal gentle throbbing.</p>

<p>He waited silent. There was now but one
thought uppermost in his mind. Yet he could
not voice it. The renewed suggestion&mdash;it surely
would be renewed&mdash;must come from Corin.
For John to give spontaneous hint of yielding in
the matter of recent discussion would be to run
the risk&mdash;though possibly merely a faint risk&mdash;of
giving himself away. Faint or blatant, the
risk was to be avoided at all cost. He smoked
on, therefore, imperturbable, his eyes for the most
part on a desk in a corner of the studio, an extremely
untidy desk, covered with papers that
looked for all the world as if they had been tossed
thereon by a whirlwind, and then stirred by an
exceedingly vigorous arm wielding a pitchfork.
Yet, for all that his eyes were upon the desk,
his thoughts were upon Corin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>
<p>“Speak, man, speak,” he was urging him by
that mental process which is termed “willing.”
“Renew your persuasions; beg me again to accompany
you on your lonely sojourn.”</p>

<p>But either Corin was no medium, or John was
no medium,&mdash;I have never been fully able to
fathom whether the willer, or the willed, or both
must be possessed of the mediumistic faculties
for satisfactory results to accrue,&mdash;certain it
is that Corin sat placidly silent, apparently entirely
oblivious of John’s mental efforts in his direction.</p>

<p>Willing can be an exhausting process, at all
events to one who is not an adept in the art.
In John’s case, as the vigour of his efforts increased,
his muscles grew tighter and tighter, till his very
toes curled with spasmodic tension inside his shiny,
polished, patent-leather boots, while a portentous
frown drew his eyebrows firmly together till they
practically met above his thin hooked nose.</p>

<p>Corin, glancing suddenly in his direction,
surprised an almost anguished expression of
countenance.</p>

<p>“Are you ill?” he ejaculated dismayed, and
with a swift half-movement towards the cupboard
where the brandy decanter was situated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>John’s face relaxed on the instant.</p>

<p>“Not in the least, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Then what on earth were you making such
faces about?” demanded Corin.</p>

<p>“I was not aware that I was making faces,”
said John with some dignity. “I was merely
thinking.”</p>

<p>“Thinking!” Corin’s light arched eyebrows
rose nearly to his fair hair. “Then, man, for
Heaven’s sake don’t do it again. It’s&mdash;it’s really
dangerous.”</p>

<p>John heaved himself out of his chair, bitterly
conscious of the futility of his efforts.</p>

<p>“Going?” said Corin. And then solicitously,
“Sure you’re really all right?”</p>

<p>“Quite, thanks,” returned John with faint
asperity.</p>

<p>Corin strolled with him to the door. John
was half-way down the stairs when he heard a
voice call after him:</p>

<p>“I’ll let you know about the train on Tuesday.”</p>

<p>John halted, turned.</p>

<p>“Well, really!” he ejaculated.</p>

<span class="smaller">A RUMOUR</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">That</span> evening John wrote a letter to his sister,
Mrs. Darcy, who lived in Ireland. The letter
contained the following paragraphs:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am going down to Malford on Tuesday, an out-of-the-way
spot near Whortley. Corin Elmore&mdash;the
painter fellow, you know who I mean&mdash;has
bothered me into it. He has got a job there, uncovering
and restoring the mural paintings in a pre-reformation
church. All seems grist that comes
to his mill. Apparently the only attractions the
place has to offer are gorgeous scenery, and later a
superabundance of blackberries, if I choose to await
their ripening. I don’t know for how long I shall
find such attractions all-satisfying.</p>

<p>“Address after Tuesday next till further notice,
The White Cottage, Malford, near Whortley.</p>

<p>“I hope Maurice and the kiddies are flourishing.</p>

<p class="right">“Your loving brother, John.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>The morning before he left town John received
a reply to his letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A sojourn, even for a short space, in such a
remote region sounds extraordinarily unlike you.
Perhaps it will have its compensations. You
will deserve them, as I am sure you are doing
this entirely on Mr. Elmore’s account. I wonder
if you will chance to meet the Delanceys. From
all I have heard Lady Mary must be a charming
woman, and I once met her granddaughter,
Rosamund Delancey. She is an exceedingly
pretty girl. Maurice raved about her in a way
that might have made a younger, and less experienced,
woman than myself jealous.</p>

<p>“I heard an extraordinary rumour some weeks
ago regarding the Delancey estate,&mdash;that an
American claimant had turned up. Personally
I gave little credence to the report. It savours
too much of melodrama for this prosaic twentieth
century. My informant had her facts pat enough,
though. But it is too long a story to deal with in
a letter, certainly too long when it is, as I believe,
pure fiction. Anyhow there’s a missing document,
a murder, and a wolf-hound connected with it.
True Adelphi melodrama!</p>
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
<p>“I hope you may chance to meet the Delanceys....”</p>
</div>

<p>John glanced up at a small statue of Our Lady,
which stood on his mantelpiece.</p>

<p>“Blessed Lady,” he said aloud in a tone at
once respectful, fervent, and charmingly friendly,
“join your prayers to her hopes.”</p>

<span class="smaller">A MEETING</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was midday in the month of August, the
sun ablaze upon wood and field. Only under the
trees and hedges the shadows lay blue and still,&mdash;intensely,
deeply blue, the warm restful blue of
summer shadows. Overhead stretched another
blue, a vault of brilliant azure, a vast cup-shaped
dome, spreading downwards from the illimitable
space above, to the hazy distant hills, to the far-off
peacock-blue sea, sun-kissed and radiant. The
warm earth breathed forth the languorous yet wide-eyed
repose of perfect summer. Here was Nature
at the maturest moment of her beauty,&mdash;the fields
golden with full-eared corn, waiting in the richness
of their dower for the first stroke of the sickle; the
moors purple with heather, and rich with a hidden
wealth of whortleberries; the hedges hung with
clusters of scarlet brambleberries, even now tinged
with the deeper hue of ripeness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>On a gate, set, after the general manner of
gates in the west of England, between two
hedges, one to the right and another to the left,
sat our friend John. From the gate, a view
stretched before him, which many an artist might
have been excused for attempting to seize and
transfer to canvas.</p>

<p>In the foreground stood a birch tree, a slender,
dainty, silver-barked thing, rising straight out
of a purple mass of heather. Its fairy lightness
was backgrounded by a wood of firs, while past
it, to the right, you got a stretch of undulating
moorland across a valley, a strip of blue sea,
and a hazy coast line of white cliffs.</p>

<p>“It really might be called a fine view,” said
John aloud. And then he broke off, for a voice
had sounded behind him,&mdash;a very young voice,
a clear treble.</p>

<p>“There’s a man sitting on the gate.” The
statement was made with the frank obviousness
of childhood.</p>

<p>John swung himself off the said gate, and
turned. This latter proceeding was distinctly
simpler to accomplish from the safety of solid
earth than from the topmost of five bars. Doubtless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
his guardian angel prompted the action, for,
on the moment of turning, his heart jumped,
leaped, and pounded in a manner peculiarly perilous.
Picture his danger with a heart in this
condition had he retained his former attitude.</p>

<p>On the other side of the gate, coming across
the grass, and not more than twenty paces from
him, was a lady accompanied by two small boys.</p>

<p>She was a young lady, tall and slender, in a
white linen frock, and a big shady straw hat.
Her hair beneath it was red gold, like burnished
copper, a vivid note of colour. The two boys, one
on either side of her, were clad in emerald green
knickerbockers, and soft white shirts. Floppy
straw hats were on their heads. Beneath the
hats you caught a glimpse of copper-coloured hair.
A vivid, vital enough picture they presented.
The smaller boy, four years old or thereabouts,
gazed solemn-eyed towards the gate; the other,
some two years or so his senior, pointed towards
our John, his face eager, alive. A stranger was
a bit of a rarity in those parts, it would appear.</p>

<p>John saw the woman turn towards the child,
caught a hint of murmured words. The boy
dropped the pointing hand. Doubtless she had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>made the suggestion&mdash;delicately put of course&mdash;that
it is not altogether the best of manners to
point at strangers, however unexpected their
appearance, as if they were some curious beast
newly escaped from the Zoo.</p>

<p>The lapse of time, from the first acclamation of
John’s position on the gate, to the dropping of
that accusing finger, had been of the briefest,
nevertheless it had allowed for a few further steps
to be taken across the grass, and the distance
between John and the three had, at the outset,
been none so great. It was clearly obvious that
the intention of the three was to pass through the
gate. Seeing this, John bent to the fastening.
By good luck it was not padlocked. Had it
been, it would have spoiled the dainty march of
the procession, actually as well as figuratively.
He swung the gate open, raising his hat at the
same moment. She bent her head, a slight though
entirely courteous gesture, gave “thank-you”
in a low round voice.</p>

<p>“Now Heaven be praised,” murmured John,
“that she did not say ‘thanks.’” By which token
it will be seen that John was a trifle fastidious as
to modes of expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>The two boys, having defeated the difficulties
of elastic beneath the chin, had likewise removed
their hats. They accomplished the restoration
of them to their heads with extraordinary dignity.
John, beholding the feat, marvelled. Then the
little cavalcade of three passed on across the
heather.</p>

<p>John gazed after them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">A BLACK AND WHITE GOAT</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">John</span> gazed after them with longing in his eyes
and resentment in his heart. The longing was
for the unattainable; the resentment that it
should be unattainable.</p>

<p>What a crassly idiotic, what an altogether
blindly stupid, doltish, and utterly mulish thing
was convention! Here were three young, gay,
and delightful creatures enjoying the summer
day in company, together revelling in the glowing
sun, the caress of the air soft as thistledown
upon one’s face, the scent of the flowers and the
warm earth, while he&mdash;John&mdash;was condemned
to loneliness, because, forsooth, of the lack of four
words. “May I introduce you.”</p>

<p>There was the password, the magic utterance
which would have smoothed away all difficulties.
It could be spoken carelessly as you please. It
could be spoken by his worst enemy with as great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>effect as by his dearest friend. Without it a
barrier, high as the highest peaks of the Andes,
loomed between him and them, a barrier to
him insurmountable, indestructible, and named,
labelled, and placarded in letters at least a foot
long, Convention. Small wonder that John
fumed inwardly, the while his eyes gazed after
the vanishing three, distilled essence of concentrated
longing in their depths.</p>

<p>Chance alone could destroy the barrier,&mdash;Chance,
the freakish, puckish sprite, who sits
with watchful eyes, smiling softly, impishly, till
the chosen moment arrives. Then, heigh presto!
Chance springs light-footed to your aid, is caught
by you laughing, or in deadly earnest, according
to your needs. And if the latter, and your grasp
is sure, you will find it is no longer an impish,
freakish sprite you hold, but a very little demon,
battling for you, trampling upon well-nigh incredible
difficulties, leading you triumphant to
victory.</p>

<p>We cannot see Chance coming in deadly earnest
to John at the moment. The imp came mischievous,
laughing, and perched, if you will
believe me, between the horns of a goat,&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>large, a black and white, an over-playful goat.
It came prancing over the purple crest of the
hill, and bounded, curved, and gavotted in the
direction of the momentarily unconscious three.</p>

<p>The younger boy was the first to see it. He
turned, startled atom, to clutch at the lady’s
white dress, thereby causing her to become aware
of the presence of the intruder on the scene.
The elder boy, likewise made aware of its presence,
seized a small stick from among the heather, a
fragile enough weapon, but with it he stood his
ground, a veritable small champion, facing the
enemy boldly.</p>

<p>But think you that Chance, perched between
those horns, was to be daunted by a small boy
in green knickerbockers, and holding a flimsy
stick? Not a bit of it! For no such paltry
pretext would he desert our John. I am very
sure he but urged the goat forward, its advance
in the face of this defence lending greater colour
to the danger.</p>

<p>“Oh!” breathed the white-robed lady, her hands
going out protectingly to the little figure clutching
at her skirts. And then, “Take care, Tony,”
on a note of intense anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Here was the moment supplied by the mischievous
imp. John recognized the sprite’s wiles
with fine intuition, cried him a fervent word of
thanks, and sprang to the rescue.</p>

<p>That Chance had never intended the slightest
peril to the three, you may be certain; since,
once seized laughing from his perch by John, he
joined with him in ordering the goat to retire.
Slightly bewildered at this change of front, the
goat gazed for a moment with reproachful eyes.</p>

<p>“I was but playing the game you told me to
play,” you could fancy him murmuring. Nevertheless,
perceiving that the game was indubitably
at an end, he indulged in something very akin
to a shake of his head, and retired disconsolate
whence he had come.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you,” breathed the lady in white
fervently. “Boys, thank&mdash;” she paused. “This
gentleman” savours too largely of the shop-walker;
the word has long since lost its rightful
meaning. “Our preserver” smacks of the pedant.</p>

<p>“My name is John Mortimer,” announced
John, with one of his inimitable smiles.</p>

<p>“Mr. Mortimer,” she concluded, the word
supplied. “I am Rosamund Delancey, and this&mdash;”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
she indicated the whilom champion, “is
Antony, and this is Michael. It was very good
of you to come to our rescue.”</p>

<p>John murmured the usual polite formula. For
the life of him he could find no original observation
to make.</p>

<p>“Possibly,” continued Rosamund, half-meditative,
a trifle rueful, “the goat intended mere play.
But as Biddy, our old nurse, often used to say&mdash;and
still does, for that matter&mdash;‘There’s play
<i>and</i> play, and if one of the parties ceases to be
liking it, it will be no play at all.’” The little
laugh in her eyes found reflection in John’s.</p>

<p>“A very sound maxim,” quoth he. And inwardly
he found himself ejaculating, “What an
adorable voice, what an altogether flexible, musical
and charming voice.”</p>

<p>Rosamund was looking down the heather-covered
slope. At the further side, a quarter
of a mile or so away, was a hedge, and in the
hedge a gate. Beyond the gate was a lane,
which, after a series of turns, would lead one
eventually to the village and Delancey Castle.
This latter, it is perhaps somewhat obvious to
remark, was her goal, and the way across the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>heather towards the gate by far the nearest
route to it. Yet how attempt that route with
the black and white goat still at large adown the
hill, eating sprays of heather&mdash;or what appeared
to be sprays of heather&mdash;in a deceitfully placid
and amicable manner?</p>

<p>“I wonder if that goat&mdash;” she began, her eyes
vaguely troubled, her brow slightly puckered.</p>

<p>“Which way do you want to go?” demanded
John promptly, the promptitude mingled with a
nice degree of deferential courtesy,&mdash;the courtesy
quite apparent, the deference a tiny subtle flavour.</p>

<p>“To that gate.” She indicated it.</p>

<p>“Then,” said John, “please allow me to accompany
you. I think Antony and I between us will
prove a match for goats. I dare to boast on our
behalf, since we have already proved our prowess
in the matter.”</p>

<p>He threw Antony a glance, a little friendly,
understanding glance. By such glances are bonds
established that will last a lifetime.</p>

<p>“Me too,” quoth Michael, breaking silence
for the first time.</p>

<p>“In very sooth, you too,” said John. “Antony
as advance guard,&mdash;not more than a couple of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>paces advance, mind you,&mdash;Michael and I on
either side. Are we ready? Then, quick march.”</p>

<p>This last was mere pandering to accepted
custom. You cannot well say, “Slow march,”
though it is what your whole soul intends. Here
is a fine illustration of the fact that speech is but
a poor mode of expressing a man’s thoughts.
And then an inspiration came to him.</p>

<p>“Not too quickly,” said he to the advance
guard. “If he thinks we are attempting to elude
him, he may pursue us. A nonchalant, a mere
careless strolling, will be our wisest course.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you think he might follow?” cried
Rosamund. The suggestion had evidently given
cause for renewed anxiety.</p>

<p>“It is possible,” returned John gravely,
“though, I fancy, not probable. However, we
will take no risks.”</p>

<p>Slowly, therefore, in mere dilatory fashion,
they set forth. The goat raised his read to look
at them; but, having his orders, he dropped it
again towards the heather.</p>

<p>Some hundred yards or so they walked in silence,
two, at least, of the party casting occasional furtive
glances to the right. John was the first to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“This,” he said, with the air of a man who has
just made a discovery, “is really beautiful country.”</p>

<p>“It is your first visit to this neighbourhood?”
queried Rosamund.</p>

<p>“My first,” returned John, “but I dare swear
it will not be my last. My friend, Corin Elmore,
dragged me down here, somewhat against my
will at the outset, I’ll allow. He’s uncovering
the mural paintings in the church down yonder.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Rosamund turned towards him, a light
of interest in her eyes. “Has he found much?”</p>

<p>“He only started on the job this morning,”
returned John. “We arrived last night. But
he’s full of confidence. There must be a curious
fascination in the work,&mdash;delving into the past,
bringing traces of bygone, forgotten ages into the
light of day.”</p>

<p>“And a certain sadness,” she suggested.</p>

<p>“And a certain sadness,” echoed John, “though
I doubt me if Corin experiences it greatly. He’s
an anomaly. For all that he’s a poet and a bit
of a dreamer, there’s a strain of the scientific
dissector running through him. It finds its outlet
in theosophic tendencies.” John pulled a wry face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>He had forgotten that he was talking to an
absolute stranger. Yet was she a stranger in
the true sense of the word? One afternoon&mdash;six
months ago as we crudely count and label time,
though to John it was centuries ago&mdash;he had had
sight of her, a mere passing glimpse, truly, since it
was of length only sufficient to allow of her mounting
the steps of the Brompton Oratory, at a
moment when John was about to descend them.
He had put a question to a friend who was with
him. And thenceforth John’s dreams had been
coloured&mdash;I might almost say suffused&mdash;by one
subject, a face with dark eyes, framed in copper-coloured
hair, and shadowed by a largish black
hat. Being, therefore, no stranger to his dreams
in spirit, it was small wonder that he regarded
her as no stranger to his perceptions in the flesh.</p>

<p>Rosamund looked at him, half amused, half
questioning.</p>

<p>“But why theosophic tendencies?” she demanded.
“I am,” she added, “peculiarly
ignorant of that trend of thought.”</p>

<p>John laughed.</p>

<p>“Nor am I vastly learned, for that matter.
If I were to attempt to define I think I should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>say that, where your scientist pure and simple
may deny the existence of God at all, your man,
like Corin, with the curious intermixture of a
dreamer, acknowledges the existence of this
Supreme Power, even endows that Power with a
certain mysticism, but at the same time reduces&mdash;or
attempts to reduce&mdash;all the actions and manifestations
of the Power to terms comprehensible
by the finite understanding.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” she queried. It was evident she
desired to hear more.</p>

<p>“Oh,” smiled John, “it’s too complicated an
affair to compress into a sentence or two. But
take, for instance, pain&mdash;the apparently undeserved
and ghastly suffering with which one is
sometimes brought in contact. Instead of saying,
as we do, that there are endless mysteries of pain
and suffering which our finite minds cannot
possibly understand, they wish to find some
quite definite and tangible solution, therefore
they adopt the Buddhistic theory of reincarnation
and karma. We work out, they say, our karma
in each succeeding incarnation for the sins of the
last. There is, in their eyes, no such thing as an
innocent victim&mdash;with one exception. All suffering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
even that of the veriest babe, is the suffering
it has deserved for former sins.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” A moment she was silent. “How
about the exception?”</p>

<p>“The exception, in their eyes, is any great
teacher, who, having fulfilled all his own karma,
voluntarily returns to teach and aid those in a
lower state of evolution. You understand that,
according to their theory, a man is bound to return
to this earth, whether he will or no, till his debt of
karma has been paid. It is only when that debt is
paid, that the return becomes voluntary; and, when
sought, is purely for the good of mankind.”</p>

<p>She looked across the heather.</p>

<p>“It would seem,” said she reflective, “that
even that theory makes something of a call
upon faith.”</p>

<p>“It does,” returned John. “And yet you must
see that it reduces the mystery of pain to terms
capable of being grasped by the human intelligence.
It’s the same with every other mystery.
There’s the makeshift in the whole business.
On the one hand they allow the existence of a God
presumably infinite; but, on the other hand, they
wish to reduce Him, and His dealings with creation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>to terms capable of understanding by their finite
intelligence. But I forgot, strictly speaking they
would not, I suppose, consider their intelligence
finite, since, according to them, there is in every
man the potential divinity.”</p>

<p>“What do they mean?” she asked. “Are
they talking about the soul?”</p>

<p>“In a sense, yes,” returned John. “But the
soul, apparently, has no exact individuality of
its own; at least, not a lasting individuality. It
is a spark, an atom, of the Great Whole, which
when it has developed to its utmost, and finished
all its work, including possible return in the body
to the earth as a teacher, will eventually receive
its reward by becoming merged and absorbed in
the Divine Whole from whence it proceeded.
Apparently, also, if a soul refuses to develop,
it can eventually be extinguished, or what is
equivalent to being extinguished.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem exactly a pleasant creed,”
said she meditative. “Absorption or extinction,
as the two final alternatives, are not what one
might term precisely satisfactory to contemplate.
It is certainly nicer to believe that one retains
one’s individuality.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“That,” John assured her, “is merely our
unconquerable egotism.”</p>

<p>“Then,” she retorted smiling, “let us hope
that it is an egotism your friend will shortly
acquire.”</p>

<p>There was a little silence. <i>Monsieur le Chèvre</i>
had been, for the moment, forgotten. Certainly
his own quiet self-effacement was conducive to
their forgetfulness of him. They were almost
at the gate before she spoke again.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” she remarked tentatively, “your
friend is not perverting you to his theories.”</p>

<p>“I trust not,” said John solemnly. And then
he added, “I am a Catholic.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” The ejaculation held the tiniest note
of pleasure. Then, after a second’s pause. “You
know that we have a chapel at the Castle.”</p>

<p>They had gained the lane by now. Antony,
who had felt the full responsibility of defence to
rest on his shoulders from the moment John’s
attention had been occupied by a wholly unintelligible&mdash;and
probably, in Antony’s eyes,
unintelligent&mdash;conversation, heaved a deep
sigh.</p>

<p>“Goats,” said he, “are horrid things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“Do you know,” quoth John, “I really have a
slight partiality towards goats myself.”</p>

<p>Which speech would have savoured more
strongly of truth had the partiality remained
unqualified.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">MURAL PAINTINGS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">John</span> walked up the flagged path of the churchyard.
Sounds of work came to him through the
little Norman doorway&mdash;the beating of hammers,
the rasping of saws, the jangle of buckets.</p>

<p>Arrived at the doorway he paused for a moment
to look at the scene before him. It would seem
almost incredible that order should ever be abstracted
from the present chaos, at all events in
the space of time proposed. Doorless, windowless,&mdash;in
the matter of glass,&mdash;it was a mere shell of a
church, filled with scaffolding, planks, barrows,
buckets; echoing with the ceaseless sound of
hammering, sawing, chiselling, planing; while,
within the shell, the creators of the various noises
moved and worked like a handful of restless
ants.</p>

<p>John looked towards the scaffolding surrounding
the east window. Perched high on a narrow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>planked platform was Corin, absorbed in his work,
entirely lost to the sounds around him.</p>

<p>John picked his way among the scattered débris
made for the chancel. Here there was a ladder
roped against a lower platform, from whence, by
means of a second ladder placed thereon, Corin’s
eyrie might be gained. John had his foot on a
rung of the first ladder in a trice, swarmed up it,
and a second or so later was giving Corin warning
of his approach by:</p>

<p>“Behold the little cherub perched aloft.”</p>

<p>Corin turned.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it? Well, just come and look.”
There was suppressed exultation in his voice.</p>

<p>John scrambled on to the platform, came alongside
Corin,&mdash;Corin who pointed with a triumphant
chisel.</p>

<p>Some half-dozen or so square yards of wall had
been cleared of many coats of plaster, and there,
on the original groundwork, stood out thin red
lines vertical and horizontal, flowers in bold
outline.</p>

<p>“Masonry, they call it,” announced Corin,
“and the flower is the herb Robert. Isn’t it
gorgeous?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>Now to the purely uninitiated, to the mere casual
observer, the adverb might have appeared unduly
extravagant. What, such a one might have
demanded, was there in a few crude brush lines
to justify this mode of speech? Yet John, artist
though he was not, understood, and not only
understood, but endorsed to the full Corin’s
rapture. Here was the work of age-old centuries,
the frank expression of some long-ago-forgotten
painter, brought once more to the light of day.
Fresh as when first limned the simple lines glowed
crimson from the cream-coloured surface of the
wall.</p>

<p>“It’s&mdash;it’s fine,” said John simply.</p>

<p>Corin, radiant, beaming, waved his chisel in a
comprehensive sweep around the walls.</p>

<p>“And think,” cried he exultant, “what more
there may be, there assuredly is, to find. Think
what further glories this plaster hides. Man, it’s
hard to restrain one’s impatience and not hack,
which would be a truly disastrous proceeding.”</p>

<p>John laughed.</p>

<p>Then, “Try another spot,” he urged. “Here,
close by the east window. I’ll not divert the
stroke of the chisel by the faintest whisper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>Pretending to a half-reluctance, though at heart,
truly, he was nothing loath to consent, Corin let
himself be persuaded. He shifted his position.
By the outer edge of the window splay he raised
his chisel and set himself to work.</p>

<p>The outer coats of plaster fell in thick flakes
before that same remorseless chisel; they crumbled
on to the platform upon which Corin stood. Below
the plaster was a thin substance lying on the wall
like a film. Here the chisel came lightly into play;
that film must be removed carefully, with touch
as delicate as the touch of a butterfly’s wing.
It entailed a suspension of breath, an excited
prevention of the merest involuntary quivering of
a muscle. The film broke and powdered at the
lightest stroke, covering Corin’s hand and wrist
with a soft grey dust. Breathless he pursued his
work; then, suddenly, he stopped, his eyes gleaming
with pleasure.</p>

<p>John bent forward. Here assuredly was novelty,&mdash;no
longer the crimson masonry, but black
chevrons set within two narrow black lines showed
on the cream-coloured wall, and extending, it was
evident, around the whole window.</p>

<p>“Ah!” breathed John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>Corin nodded, his chisel again raised.</p>

<p>In places the plaster adhered like glue to the
walls; it had to be chipped away inch by inch, and
through sheer force. Here it was that the work
required the greatest skill and dexterity. The
pressure of the chisel by an extra hair’s breadth
would have meant the cutting through of the film
below the plaster, and destroying the painting that
lay beneath. It required a fine strength of wrist,
the calculation to a nicety of the depth to which to
cut, above all, an infinity of patience. Yet, again,
there were patches where not only the plaster,
but the film with it, flaked away at the lightest
stroke, and here the painting was at its freshest.</p>

<p>For full twenty minutes John gave close eye to
the proceedings. At the end of that time he
sighed, a mere tiny sigh. If Corin heard, he
heeded not. Stepping back a pace he regarded
his work, head on one side, soul absorbed.</p>

<p>John took him firmly by the arm.</p>

<p>“I vowed I’d not divert the stroke of the chisel
by the faintest whisper,” he announced. “At the
moment shouting would be harmless. Therefore
let me tell you in merely normal tones that I’m
hungry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“Hungry!” Corin blinked at him. “What’s
the time?”</p>

<p>“Long past the luncheon hour,” John assured
him. “Come!”</p>

<p>Corin reluctantly laid down his chisel, turned
for a final look at masonry, herb Robert, and
chevrons.</p>

<p>“And to think,” he ejaculated, “that the plaster
hides all this! There must be ten coats of plaster
or thereabouts. After the first Goth, the first
horrible Philistine, plastered, no one can have
known what was hidden, and they just went on
plastering at intervals. I’ve made out six plasters
for certain,&mdash;grey, green, white adorned with
awful scroll-work, purple, green again with more
scroll-work, and then this dingy brown,” he waved
his hand towards the walls. “There are other
plasters so stuck together no one can distinguish
them, and underneath it all, this.” He touched
a flower in a kind of subdued and dreamy
ecstasy.</p>

<p>John took him once more kindly but firmly by
the arm.</p>

<p>“It’s extremely beautiful,” he said in a tone
conciliatory. “Presently you shall rhapsodize
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>again to your heart’s content and I’ll help you.
At the moment,” he propelled him gently towards
the ladder, “we leave ecstasy for the mundane,
the mere sordid occupation of eating.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">MRS. TRIMWELL</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Trimwell</span>, brisk, black eyed, white-aproned,
entered with a covered dish.</p>

<p>Corin, deep in an armchair, was smoking a
cigarette.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said he meditative, between the inhalations
of smoke, “what the old painter of the church
down yonder thinks of our proceedings. It would
be interesting to hear his own reflections on the
subject. Presumably he does reflect. If his spirit
haunts the church, possibly some fine evening I shall
see him. Then I shall put a question or two.”</p>

<p>John merely laughed, and approached the table.
Mrs. Trimwell, raising a dish-cover, disclosed two
golden-brown soles, perfect samples of her culinary
art.</p>

<p>“I have never,” continued Corin, still reflective,
“seen a spirit, but I firmly believe that one might
be seen under favourable conditions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“Come and eat,” laughed John.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell eyed Corin for a moment in
hesitating fashion. Then she spoke with the air
of one embarking on a weighty question, though
addressing herself to John.</p>

<p>“There’s never no knowing, sir, what it mightn’t
be given you nor any one to see. I seed an angel
myself once.”</p>

<p>Corin paused in the act of handing John a plate
on which reposed one of the soles.</p>

<p>“An angel!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>John took the plate.</p>

<p>“An angel!” he echoed dubious.</p>

<p>“I seed it,” reiterated Mrs. Trimwell, “as plain as
I see you. I was doing my bit of ironing, the baby&mdash;that’s
the youngest, sir&mdash;asleep in the cradle under
the table, so as I could give the rocker a jog with my
foot now and again, and the angel comed in.”</p>

<p>She paused, watching the effect of her words.</p>

<p>“But how?” queried John busy with the sole.
“Through the window, the ceiling, or the floor? Angels,
you know, are spirits, not corporeal weighty humans
like ourselves. They’d never,” concluded
John gravely, “make an ordinary, an expected
entrance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>Corin glanced at him sternly.</p>

<p>“I should have imagined you would have held
the matter too sacred for joking about,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>John smiled gently.</p>

<p>“This one,” said Mrs. Trimwell firmly, “came
through the door. I heard the outer door click,
and said I to myself, ‘That’s Robert for sure.’
I thought he’d come home a bit earlier. Then the
kitchen door clicked. It opened just a little ways,
and the beautifullest angel you ever seed comed in
all floaty-like. I was that scared I dropped my
iron&mdash;there’s the heat mark on the baby’s robe
to this day&mdash;and I made a clean bolt for the back
door. I never thought of the baby nor nothing.
And as I bolted I squinnied over my shoulder, and
I seed that angel by the table all white and shiny.”</p>

<p>Again she stopped, and regarded John, who was
eating steadily. To Corin, who was all agog for a
continuance of the story, she perversely paid no
heed.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;” began John dubious.</p>

<p>“You may doubt me as much as you like, sir.
I wasn’t going back to that kitchen without a
neighbour. I told Vicar myself, sir, and he didn’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>believe me neither, though I’m a truthful woman.
For as I says to my children: ‘You tell the truth
at all costs. If you’re in a hole don’t tell a lie to
try and get out of it. Truth will always give you
the surest hand up even though her clutch is a bit
severe.’ I’d not deceive you, sir, and ’tis the
truth I’ve spoken as I spoke it to Vicar. I seed
that angel.”</p>

<p>Finality in her tone she stood there, slightly
challenging, yet respectful withal.</p>

<p>“Hmm!” mused John. “Your integrity, Mrs.
Trimwell, is, I am convinced, above suspicion.
Yet why, do you imagine, should the angel come?
What, do you take it, was the motive for his
visit?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell approached a step nearer. She
lowered her voice to a confidential whisper.</p>

<p>“’Twas that day to the minute, sir, as my uncle
died.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” John’s eyes, non-committal in expression,
sought the window. Corin cast a look of
scorn at him; then turned, eager, to Mrs. Trimwell.</p>

<p>“Did you tell the Vicar that?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I did, sir,” replied Mrs. Trimwell, including
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>him for the first time within her range of vision.
“But, Lor’, where’s the use of telling things to he!
He don’t understand no more than a Bishop.”</p>

<p>“Why a Bishop?” thought John in parenthesis.</p>

<p>“When my Tilda was down with pneumony,”
pursued Mrs. Trimwell reminiscent, “and the
doctor said there wasn’t no chance for her, ‘I’ll
see about chances,’ says I. Vicar, he talked about
the Will of the Lord and submitting. ‘It’s not the
minute to be talking about submitting yet,’ says
I to him. ‘The Lord may do the willing, and I’m
not one to deny it, but ’tis we do the doing, and it
kind of fits in. And if you think I’m going to leave
off fighting for my Tilda till the time comes as
she’s ready to lay out, you’re much mistook.’ He
was mistook, sir, for she’s in the kitchen now
a-minding of the baby.” She ended on a note
gloriously triumphant.</p>

<p>The triumph found quick response in John’s
eyes. I fancy he saw here reflected the attitude
of that old-time king, who strove in prayer for his
child, till striving and prayer were no longer of
avail.</p>

<p>“The fighting chance,” murmured Corin, swallowing
his last mouthful of sole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell removed the plates and placed
cold chicken and salad on the table.</p>

<p>“In a manner of speaking it was,” said she,
eyeing him with approval. She moved towards
the door, then turned.</p>

<p>“You will take coffee after lunch?” she asked.</p>

<p>John looked his assent, yet left it to Corin, as in
a manner host, to give verbal reply to the query.</p>

<p>“By all means,” replied Corin. “I need,” he
assured her, “every atom of support at your avail.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell looked at him commiseratingly.</p>

<p>“I’ll be bound it’s hard work down there,” said
she sympathetically. “How do you find it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Interesting,” returned Corin, “distinctly interesting.
I feel like an explorer of bygone centuries
penetrating through modern hideousity, early
Victorian crudeness, Puritan dreariness, and
various other glooms, to the sweet, kindly simplicity,
the grace, the freshness, the love of beauty,
appertaining to the olden days. I am,” concluded
Corin, helping himself to salad, “crumbling to
pieces that which has hidden beauty, and exposing
beauty to the light of day. In other words, I’m
scraping the plaster off the walls of the church,
and enjoying myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell nodded, frank approbation
plainly visible on her face.</p>

<p>“And time it was scraped, too. A mucky looking
place it was with them walls all stained and
chipped and mildewed. Not that it hurt me much,
seeing as I never go inside it, except it’s for a
christening or a burial.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” remarked Corin, and somewhat feebly,
be it stated.</p>

<p>John cast a whimsical look in his direction.</p>

<p>“I don’t hold with church-going,” pursued Mrs.
Trimwell calmly. “Say your prayers at home if
you want to say them, says I. And as for sermons,&mdash;if
you’ve heard Vicar talk out of the pulpit
whether you will or no, you don’t run off smiling
to hear him talk in it. Leastways I don’t. There’s
some as does, I know.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Corin again, and this time more
feebly. (John, I fear me, was laughing inwardly.)
To disagree with Mrs. Trimwell would, Corin felt,
be tantamount to calling her a black kettle, setting
up himself the while as a shiny brass pot, to
which title he knew he possessed no manner of
right. Yet to agree!&mdash;Well, Corin’s conscience,
some hidden fragment of convention&mdash;call it what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>you will&mdash;felt a slight hint of repugnance at her
sentiments.</p>

<p>There is your man, your male individual, all
over. Dogmatic religion&mdash;however vague the
dogma&mdash;church-going is often outside his own
category, yet for his women folk&mdash;any women
folk&mdash;to speak against it holds for him a hint of
distaste. It just serves to destroy that soft light
of idealism with which he loves to surround women.
Every man has one woman, at least, in this
idealistic shrine, or, if he has not, he is of all men
most miserable. And here it is that your adherents
to the old Faith&mdash;the oldest Faith in Christendom&mdash;have
a pull over your so-called enlightened
individual. There is always One Woman to whom
those of that old Faith can turn, one for whom no
shrine is too fair, too lofty,&mdash;can be bedecked with
no too costly wealth of love and homage. Here,
in this shrine, at her feet, may every idealistic
thought of man towards woman be placed,
preserved, and cherished.</p>

<p>Corin, as already stated, said “Oh!” an ejaculation
at once feeble, utterly lacking in significance
of any kind, a mere signal that his ears had received
the speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“Miss Rosamund don’t hold with my views,”
went on Mrs. Trimwell, while John’s heart gave a
sudden throb. “Not that I pays over-much heed
to her, being a Papist what’s bound to go to
Church and obey their priests if they don’t want
any little unpleasantness in the next world, which
I takes it may be a considerable more unpleasantness
than you nor I would suppose. Still I will
say she has a wonderful way of talking a thing
clear, and if I didn’t <i>know</i> that popery was no
better than a worshipping of graven images, I
might go for to believe her.”</p>

<p>Corin glanced anxiously in the direction of John,&mdash;John
who was eating chicken with an expressionless
face, though I’ll not vouch that his shoulders
didn’t shake a little now and then.</p>

<p>“Not that Miss Rosamund talks goody talk,”
pursued Mrs. Trimwell, “which is a thing I never
could abide in grown-up or child, and burnt them
little tracty books they give my Tilda up to Sunday-school,
setting of her off to talk texes to me and
her father, which we didn’t smack her for though
she deserved it. But there, she’d have been
thinking she was an infant prodigal and a Christian
martyr if we had. No; I just said how if she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>was so fond of texes she could learn a few more
instead of going along blackberrying with the
other children, and I sets her down to get a chapter
of the Gospels by heart. We didn’t hear no more
of texes after that, didn’t me and her father,”
concluded Mrs. Trimwell dryly.</p>

<p>Indubitably the corners of John’s mouth were
twitching now. Then Mrs. Trimwell’s eye caught
his. Laughter came, whole-heartedly to John, to
Mrs. Trimwell first with a note of half apology,
over which the entire humour of the reminiscence
presently got the upper hand. Corin joined in
somewhat relieved. He had feared lest John’s
feelings might be hurt.</p>

<p>“When I thinks of Tilda setting there not
knowing whether to sulk or pretend she liked it!”
ejaculated Mrs. Trimwell after a moment. She
wiped the tears of laughter from her eyes with her
apron. “But there, it was coffee I was going after,
and not memories of my Tilda.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell vanished.</p>

<span class="smaller">FLIGHTS OF FANCY</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Corin</span> looked dubiously at John.</p>

<p>“She talks a good deal,” quoth he tentatively.</p>

<p>“I have,” returned John, “conceived a great
affection for Mrs. Trimwell. Her ideas are original.
She has, also, a distinct prejudice in favour of
speaking her mind with a candour and verve which
I find undeniably refreshing. Yes; certainly I
have conceived an affection for her.”</p>

<p>Corin snorted.</p>

<p>“Every man to his own taste,” said he. “For
my part I find her over-fluent of speech.”</p>

<p>“That,” replied John, “arises merely from a
tendency I have frequently noted in you to
monopolize the whole conversation; to mop it, so
to speak, into your own sponge, thereby leaving
the sponges of others bone dry.”</p>

<p>“I have never,” retorted Corin, “observed that
your sponge lacked moisture, if you will use terms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>of parable instead of straightforward words. But
to leave Mrs. Trimwell for the moment. How did
you enjoy the morning? Did I expand one whit
too freely on the glories of the surrounding country?
Is there not colour,&mdash;radiant, vital colour
at every turn?”</p>

<p>“I’ll allow there’s sufficient beauty hereabouts,”
conceded John.</p>

<p>“And you had a pleasant time? Own to the
truth. It was worth while sacrificing sun-baked
streets for wide stretches of glorious moorland?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll own to the worth whileness of it,”
laughed John, hugging a delicious secret to his
heart.</p>

<p>Corin shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“You might be a trifle more expansive,” he
grumbled. “You might give me an epitome of
your morning’s experiences. There was I, perched
like a hen on a henroost, slaving my life out for
four hours, while you were enjoying glorious
freedom. I said to myself, he’ll return enthusiastic.
I’ll have, at least, a second-hand experience of
purple moorland, sun-kissed sea, and cool green
woods. And all the man has done is to smile
oracularly, and admit to beauty when the admission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
was fairly dragged from his lips. No;
don’t begin to rhapsodize now. It’s too late. I
wanted spontaneity, a first fine careless rapture.
And by dragging, pulling, and tugging, I get a
bare admission of beauty grudgingly made.”</p>

<p>John laughed again. It must be confessed that
he was in a peculiarly lighthearted mood.</p>

<p>“I’ll attempt no rhapsody, no poetic flights of
fancy, since the psychological moment for so doing
has, according to you, passed. I’ll give you the
mere salient facts of the morning, the chiefest
being that I played St. George to the dragon.”</p>

<p>Corin eyed him suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I have an idea I heard you remark ‘no poetic
flights of fancy,’ a moment agone,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“I did,” retorted John, “and I adhere to that
remark. Here is fact pure and simple. But, for
your better convincing, I will state that the dragon
had for the moment disguised itself as a goat,&mdash;a
large, a playful, black and white goat. The
disguise was good, I’ll allow, but,” concluded
John dramatically, “I penetrated it.”</p>

<p>Corin sighed.</p>

<p>“If you could divest your speech of symbolism,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>said he pathetically, “and give me facts in plain
English.”</p>

<p>“No symbolism I assure you,” protested John.
“It was a goat,&mdash;a black and white goat. It
curved, it gavotted, it gambolled, thereby causing
much distress to a fair lady and her two attendant
knights, who were, believe me, hardly of an age to
deal convincingly with either goats or dragons.
Then, behold, enter St. George.” He struck
himself upon the chest.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Corin began to find a thread of reasonableness
among the nonsense. “Who was the
lady, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“She told me,” said John, “that her name was
Miss Rosamund Delancey.” He experienced a
strange sensation of pleasure in pronouncing
the words.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Corin a second time. “From the
Castle.”</p>

<p>“From the Castle,” echoed John.</p>

<p>Corin reflected, mused. Finally, seeing that
John had come to an end of the repast, he pushed
back his chair, rose from the table, and lighted a
cigarette.</p>

<p>“I have heard a rumour,” said he, the cigarette
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>lighted, “that they are shortly leaving the Castle
on account of some claimant who has turned up.
I can’t remember the whole story. I know it
struck me as sufficiently melodramatic at the
moment,&mdash;murders, missing documents, and little
Adelphi touches of that kind were mixed up in it.
But I daresay it’s nothing but a rumour.”</p>

<p>“Let us trust so,” said John devoutly.</p>

<span class="smaller">AN OLD PRIEST</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Father Maloney</span> was in a mood, which, it must
be confessed, was distinctly unfavourable to his
peace of mind. And not only his peace of mind,
but his appetite had suffered considerably thereby.
Cold corned beef and plum tart had been so much
sawdust between his lips, flavourless and exceeding
dry. Even his after-luncheon pipe failed to rouse
him to a cheerier outlook on life in general. Now,
when the joys of tobacco had ceased to woo him,
matters had, indeed, come to a pretty pass.
Anastasia, his housekeeper, clearing away the
débris of the meal, eyed him solicitously.</p>

<p>“You’re not ill, Father?” she asked, her black
eyes snapping anxiety in his direction.</p>

<p>For a moment he roused himself.</p>

<p>“Not at all, not at all,” he responded with a
show of briskness, only to relapse once more into
gloom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>Anastasia shook her head.</p>

<p>“It’ll be that moidering business up to the
Castle, I’m thinking,” quoth she to herself, her
lips tightening in a manner that would have
augured ill for the author of the business had he
been anywhere within sighting distance.</p>

<p>Returning to the kitchen she addressed a
fervent, and, it must be confessed, slightly
authoritative decade of the rosary to Our
Blessed Lady, before beginning to wash up plates
and dishes. To her mind <i>something</i> had to be
done. Herein her mind and that of old Biddy
the nurse up at the Castle were distinctly in
accord.</p>

<p>For one hour&mdash;two hours, perhaps&mdash;Father
Maloney sat in his old armchair. During that
time he endeavoured, with some degree of success,
to say his office with attention. Then he once
more lapsed into gloomy retrospection and
anticipation.</p>

<p>Since midday the world&mdash;the pleasant, material,
sunny world&mdash;had been turned upside down for
him. It is true that this inversion had been
looked for, feared, for the last six months, but that
fact did not prevent the present phenomenon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>from being any the less unpleasant when it
actually occurred. It requires a peculiarly level
head, not to say a certain degree of something
almost akin to callousness, to regard matters from
so totally different a point of view. It is a position
to which you cannot readily adjust yourself. At
all events Father Maloney found it one to which
he could not readily adjust himself. It required
a supreme effort on his part merely to hang on, so
to speak.</p>

<p>“Sure, and I ought to have been more prepared
for it,” he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>Getting out of his chair he went into the little
hall, reached down his hat, and took his stick
from the stand. Anastasia saw him through the
open door of the kitchen. She came to it, a small
dried-up woman.</p>

<p>“You’re not going out without your tea,
Father,” she protested. “The water in the
kettle is boiling this very minute.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not be wanting any tea,” returned Father
Maloney opening the front door.</p>

<p>Anastasia went back into the kitchen, shaking
her head sorrowfully at the steaming kettle on the
stove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Father Maloney went slowly down the lane.
It was powdered thickly with white dust, since,
for a fortnight past at least, the sky by day had
been blue and brazen, at night starlit and cloudless.</p>

<p>Two small girls passed him, belonging to his
own flock. They dipped him profound curtseys,
glancing at him with bright bird-like eyes. He
gave but abstracted response to their salutation,
which fact elicited from them surprised and regretful
comment as soon as he was out of earshot.
Though, for that matter, they might, at the
moment, have reproached him under his very
nose, and gained no hearing.</p>

<p>Leaving the lane presently, he turned through a
gate, and up the slope of a grassy field. He had
need of wider expanses than the hedged-in lane
afforded him.</p>

<p>He climbed slowly, pausing every now and then
to take breath. At last he gained the summit.
Finding the sun distinctly warm, and being heated
by the ascent, he lowered himself slowly on to the
short dry grass. So busy was he with his own
reflections, that he did not perceive a young man
lying in the shade of a blackberry bush some
hundred or so paces to his right. But it is very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>certain that the young man saw him; and, seeing
him, observed him intently.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Corin had returned to his work, John
had again betaken himself to the open.</p>

<p>It was fairly obvious, so concluded John
shrewdly, that a route chosen for a morning ramble
was not likely to be again sought in the afternoon.
The proceeding would savour too strongly of
unoriginality of ideas. But, so he pondered within
his mind, it was just possible that some other
route might be chosen, and that by the favour
of the gods he might hit upon it. Therefore
he had set out, leaving matters to those same
gods.</p>

<p>Having, after circumlocutious and disappointed
walking, gained his present post of eminence, he
had lain down in the shadow of a blackberry bush
to muse over, and carp at, the fickleness of the
gods to whom he had trusted, and incidentally to
survey the surrounding country for a moving
white-robed figure.</p>

<p>Till this present, no figure of any kind had come
within his range of vision; then, five minutes or so
agone, turning his eyes leftwards, he had perceived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>a stout elderly priest climbing the hillside towards
him.</p>

<p>Here was some solace. If it were not the rose
herself, it was at least one who, it might pretty
safely be concluded, was tolerably well acquainted
with the rose. A small backwater of a place,
such as Malford, does not, he might suppose,
yield many priests, nor even, presumably, more
than one. There was little doubt in his mind but
that the approaching figure was the priest who
officiated at Delancey Chapel.</p>

<p>John observed him intently, as I have said. He
saw him lower himself on to the grass with the
slow deliberate movement of a stoutish man, saw
him gazing straight in front of him. From his
position John had a view of his face in something
less than profile, but it was the dejection of his
attitude, rather than his face, that at the moment
impressed our John. He watched him, intent,
absorbed.</p>

<p>“Something,” observed John mentally, “has
recently upset his equilibrium. Like a wise man
he has come into the open to gain restoration of
balance.”</p>

<p>Which mental observation showed John to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>possessed of no little shrewdness, as you will
perceive. And then, by a really marvellous leap
of intuition, he bounced straight into the heart of
affairs, went in with a splash, and came up gasping.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried John to his soul, “that rumour, that
obnoxious and detestable rumour is true, and he
has just been made aware of the unassailable fact.
The poor old fellow!”</p>

<p>No wonder he looked dejected, no wonder he
gazed with all his eyes in the direction of the towers
of Delancey Castle plainly visible above the distant
trees. If the rumour were true, and John
was now very certain of its truth, it was enough to
wring tears from the heart of a flint, to call forth
protestation from the tongueless trees and mute
stones of the old Castle itself.</p>

<p>An American claimant to that place! that
utterly and entirely English place! Its very walls,
its surrounding trees and fields, were so unmistakably
and undeniably English. You might
have taken up the whole thing and planted it down
in any remote and unexpected quarter of the globe
that you had chosen, and its whole atmosphere
would have shrieked its English origin dumbly,
but quite, quite explicitly, at you. At any time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>its origin would have been unassailable, and truly
fifty times more so at this present moment, as it
lay serene and peaceful in the blue and golden
warmth of an August afternoon.</p>

<p>And now it was to be claimed by an American.</p>

<p>John suffered from no racial prejudice, I would
have you to believe; but there were some things
that could be, and some things that could not be.
And for Delancey Castle to be in any but English
hands would be, to his way of thinking, a thing
as incongruous and impossible as that a Chinese
should don the kilt of the Highlander, or that a
South Sea Islander should assume the Irish
brogue. Oh, it was preposterous, preposterous,
preposterous. It was altogether unthinkable and
unimaginable.</p>

<p>And then suddenly he was aware of a difference
in the old priest’s attitude. It was a tiny difference,
a subtle and quite inexplicable difference,
nevertheless it existed. And all at once John felt
himself a bit of an intruder, looking at what he
had no atom of right to see. Had he not feared
that movement would make his presence known,
he would have moved on the instant. As it was
he became absorbed in pulling up small blades of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>grass from the ground. He pulled at them
fiercely, his eyes fixed upon them, the while he
was most intensely aware of that motionless old
figure a hundred paces from him.</p>

<p>At length a sound&mdash;it might have been a half
cough&mdash;caused him to raise his eyes again. He
saw the old priest pulling a pipe and tobacco
pouch from his pocket.</p>

<p>John watched him. The pipe filled, and the
pouch replaced, Father Maloney still fumbled at
his pockets. It would appear that something was
missing.</p>

<p>“Matches!” said John. And cautiously he
heaved himself to his feet. Softly he advanced
some steps, came to a line directly behind the
old priest, then marched boldly forward.</p>

<p>“Can I be of any use?” John held out a box
towards him.</p>

<p>Father Maloney looked up surprised.</p>

<p>“I’m much obliged. Where did you appear
from?”</p>

<p>“From over there.” John waved his hand in a
backward and non-committal direction. “I saw
you intended lighting your pipe, but your intentions
were being frustrated.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>“Can’t think how I forgot them,” said Father
Maloney pulling at his pipe.</p>

<p>John dropped on to the ground beside him.</p>

<p>“What a view!” he announced in a pleasantly
conversational tone. “And what a day!”</p>

<p>“It is that indeed,” returned Father Maloney
cheerfully.</p>

<p>John hugged himself inwardly.</p>

<p>“He’s got the hang of things again, brave old
fellow!” he ejaculated mentally. “But I’d give a
very great deal to know the veritable standpoint
of affairs.”</p>

<p>Aloud he said. “Am I right in imagining that
you are the chaplain of Delancey Castle?”</p>

<p>“I am,” said Father Maloney. “What made
you think so?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said John airily, “one does not expect
to see a superabundance of priests in a Protestant
country, and when it comes to a minute spot such
as this, where you happen to know there is one
priest,&mdash;well, when you see him, you imagine he’s
the one,” concluded John explicitly.</p>

<p>Father Maloney’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>“Under the circumstances, as stated by you,
the inference might be drawn,” quoth he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>And then followed a little silence. Both men
were looking towards Delancey Castle, and it may
be pretty safely conjectured that the thoughts of
both were occupied by that same Castle.</p>

<p>John, if the truth be known, was longing&mdash;fervently
longing&mdash;that the old priest should give
voice to that matter, which, he was fully aware,
was uppermost in their minds. For him to broach
the subject would, he feared, savour too strongly
of impertinence on the part of a complete stranger.
Yet it is very certain that, without any undue
curiosity on his part, he desired intensely to know
the actual rights of the case, to arrive at the
veritable truth of the rumour which had twice
reached his ears.</p>

<p>Now whether John’s desire was sufficiently
intense to communicate itself to Father Maloney,
or whether it was that the subject which so absorbed
the old priest’s mind was bound to find an
outlet in speech, you may settle as best pleases
you. For my part, I have no definite opinion to
offer on the matter, though I sway slightly in
favour of the latter conclusion. When every nook
and cranny of the mind is filled with a thought
which increases in volume the more it is absorbed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>there comes a point when an outlet in speech is
practically a necessity, and, to my thinking, this
point had been reached in the present case of
Father Maloney’s mind. Also it is quite possible
that he recognized the silent and unobtrusive
sympathy of John. Certain it is that he began to
speak.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll have heard the news of yonder
Castle?” he asked, pulling at his pipe.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard rumours,” acquiesced John, “which
I devoutly trusted were nothing more.”</p>

<p>“I trusted that myself,” said Father Maloney
grimly. “But the truth of them is clinched now,
and that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said John quietly. And then, “Would
you tell me the story? I should like to hear it, if
you wouldn’t mind telling it.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, since you’d be caring to hear it
But it’s a longish tale, and a bit complicated at
that. It might be boring you.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” declared John fervently.
“I’ve been wanting to hear the truth of the matter
ever since the first rumour reached my ears.
Honestly,” he continued smiling, “it has been
nothing but the fear of a snub that prevented me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>from broaching the subject the first moment I
dropped on the grass beside you.”</p>

<p>Father Maloney smiled.</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” he said.</p>

<span class="smaller">AN OLD-TIME TRAGEDY</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">After</span> a moment, during which Father Maloney
was, I imagine, sorting his ideas, seeking for the
best beginning to the promised complicated story,
he began to speak.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll know, of course, that the Delanceys
are a very old family. The baronetcy dates
back to the time of the Crusaders. The family
have never lost the Faith, as we Catholics say.
The matter which has given rise to the present
upset happened in the year seventeen hundred
and thirteen. The then baronet was one Sir
Michael Delancey, his wife, Helen, <i>née</i> Montgomery.
But sure that’s nothing to do with the
tale at all. There were three children by the
marriage, Henry, Antony, and Rosamund. It was
with Henry that the difficulty arose. He was&mdash;well,
I fear there’s no denying that he was a rogue,
with no decent feeling in him at all. A card-playing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
drinking fella he was, and not above
doing a thought of cheating if it happened that the
luck was going against him. Well, it was in one
of these card routs that things came to a crisis.
There was cheating and quarrelling and what not,
and at the end a duel. Henry killed his man, and
raced off to his home to lie low a bit in hiding. The
old man&mdash;Sir Michael&mdash;was sick of him and his
ways by that time, I’m thinking. Anyhow he
agreed to smuggle him out of the country, but on
one condition, and here’s the first, and, for that
matter, the whole point of the business. Before he
was shipped off he had to sign some paper or other
renouncing all claim to the property, indeed disinheriting
himself in favour of his younger brother,
Antony. Somehow it seems that the old man had
not the right to disinherit him himself.”</p>

<p>“Entail, I suppose,” said John lighting a fresh
cigarette.</p>

<p>“Something of the kind, I’ve no doubt,”
returned Father Maloney. “Legally, I’m thinking,
he’d still have inherited the title, but the
bargain was that he was to go off for ever, be, in a
manner of speaking, dead to the heritage of his
forebears in any shape or form. And his heirs to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>be dead to it likewise. Be that as may be, he
went off, having renounced all claim to the
property. Five years later his brother Antony
succeeded to it.”</p>

<p>Father Maloney paused, then a moment later
resumed his tale.</p>

<p>“Antony married Margaret de Courcey, a fine
woman from all accounts, and by her he had
four children, Antony, Richard, Rosamund, and
Michael. Now comes along the next point of
interest. Ten years after Sir Antony had succeeded
to the property and title, Henry reappeared upon
the scene. There’s no doubt but that he had it
in his mind to make matters as unpleasant for
Antony as might be. He was married, so he said,
and had two sons. Margaret was away from home
at the time, and the whole business is clearly
shown in letters she received from her husband,
Sir Antony. The letters are still in existence. In
them Sir Antony tells her of Henry’s reappearance,
and sets forth his reluctance to do the obvious
thing and inform the law his brother has returned,&mdash;which
would have been mightily unpleasant for
Henry, I’m thinking. Sure, he must have been a
daring fella to have come back to England at all.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>Sir Antony tells her, too, clearly enough, Henry’s
motive in coming, and it’s one a blind man might
be seeing without over-much difficulty. It was the
paper he’d signed he was after. If he could destroy
that, why, it would leave his son free to inherit
the title and property at his death. He couldn’t
think to be getting them himself without more of a
boggle than he’d have a liking for. But it would
be another matter for his son. You’ll be finding
all this in the first two letters Sir Antony wrote to
Margaret, as well as the whole history of the signing
of the paper. Perhaps after a fashion she knew
of that before, but not over-definitely. Anyhow
Sir Antony writes it all down, and it is from that
letter we know of the matter. A third letter, and
a shorter one, shows that Sir Antony is getting a
trifle uneasy with Henry hanging around, and
that he means to remove the paper from the strong
box, where it was kept, to some hiding-place of
sorts. But never a hint did he give of where that
hiding-place would be at all.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” remarked John shrewdly, “he had
no mind to put his ideas on paper.”</p>

<p>“’Tis more than likely,” returned Father
Maloney grimly, “but it’s a deal of trouble he’d
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>have been saving if he’d given the merest suspicion
of a hint. A fourth letter was sent to Margaret
Delancey, written by one Francis Raymond,
a priest. ’Tis a sad letter, and a fine letter too,
for that matter. He begs her to come home without
delay, and tells her of her husband’s death.
He goes straight at what he has to say, and then
gives her the comfort the poor soul would be
needing,&mdash;though it’s plain he knows the manner
of woman she is, and the courage of her. There’s
a hint in his letter of foul play of some kind.
Other papers, Margaret’s own diary among them,
tell what that foul play was. Sir Antony had
been found in the park, under an oak tree, shot
through the head. Henry was lying near him, a
pistol not ten inches from his hand, and his throat
torn out by Sir Antony’s wolf-hound.”</p>

<p>“What a ghastly business!” ejaculated John,
as Father Maloney stopped.</p>

<p>“You may well say that,” remarked Father
Maloney. “The matter was plain enough. Henry
had shot his brother with the idea of getting hold
of that precious paper unhindered, but he had
forgotten&mdash;or, maybe, never realized&mdash;the presence
of Sir Antony’s wolf-hound, Gelert. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>dog wasn’t one to let his master’s murderer go
unpunished.”</p>

<p>Again there was a little pause. Father Maloney
refilled his pipe.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said after a minute, “after Sir Antony’s
death, his son Antony came into possession.
But&mdash;” Father Maloney emphasized the word
with an emphatic movement of his pipe, “that
paper desired by Henry had vanished. Wherever
Sir Antony had hidden it, the hiding-place was a
bit too good. It has never been found.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” suggested John tentatively, “Henry
had destroyed it.”</p>

<p>Father Maloney shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. If Henry had destroyed it
before he shot his brother there’d have been no
need for the shooting at all. He shot his brother
to get at the paper, but Gelert was one too many
for him. And never a scrap of paper was found
upon, or near him.”</p>

<p>“And,” said John ruminatively, “that has
proved an awkward business.”</p>

<p>“It has that,” said Father Maloney drily. “A
claimant has turned up.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said John quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, ’tis a pretty boggle,” went on Father
Maloney, “it is that. This fella, this David
Delancey arrives from Africa&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Africa!” interrupted John. “I heard he was
an American?”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis Africa he has come from,” said Father
Maloney. “He arrives as cool as a cucumber.
‘I’m the rightful owner of this place,’ says he in a
letter to Lady Mary. ‘I’ve every proof, and send
copies of them.’ ’Tis a long rigmarole how he got
hold of them. Of course there was a lawyers’
investigation. That’s been going on for months.
But ’tis proved now beyond no manner of doubt
that he is the direct descendant of that scoundrel
Henry, and not a scrap of legal proof have we got
on our side that Henry ever renounced the claim
to the property. There’s the whole business.
Lady Mary got the letter from the lawyer fellas
this morning. ’Tis full of their jargon, but the
meaning is plain enough through it all. David
Delancey is the rightful heir, and no vestige of
right has this little Antony here to stick or stone
of the old place.”</p>

<p>Father Maloney stopped.</p>

<p>“It’s&mdash;it’s preposterous!” ejaculated John hotly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>Father Maloney smiled, an untranslatable, an
enigmatic smile.</p>

<p>“When does he take possession?” demanded
John.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s written a decent enough letter,”
responded Father Maloney. “He says there can
be time enough taken for the handing over of the
property. ‘Take six months, or a year about it, for
that matter,’ says he. He’ll be coming down here
in a day or so to the inn to look around and get
the hang of affairs, though he’s in no way anxious
to intrude.”</p>

<p>“Intrude!” snorted the wrathful John.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” interpolated Father Maloney
soothingly, “he’ll be within his rights according
to those lawyer fellas.”</p>

<p>John gazed sternly before him.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he has an atom of right,” he
announced emphatically.</p>

<p>Again Father Maloney smiled.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll allow we’re all of us for that way
of thinking ourselves. But private opinion
has never overridden the law yet, without proof
in the plainest black and white to back it
up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>John heaved a portentous sigh.</p>

<p>Here, at least, was fact indisputable. Matters
for the present inhabitants of Delancey Castle
were at a deadlock, a deadlock of the tightest and
most emphatic kind. There was no denying
that a stoic philosophy was the only course open
to them.</p>

<p>But stoic philosophy on such a matter! How
was any living human creature possessed of a
drop of warm tingling blood in his veins to encompass
such a state of being? He saw the trio
as they had come towards him in the August
sunshine that morning,&mdash;the girl tall, graceful,
breathing vitality, temperament; the merest
casual observer must have felt her extraordinary
capacity for feeling things intensely. Oh,
it was no imagination on his part, imagination
fed by the white light of idealism with which
he had surrounded her. Verily was there no
imagination on his part. She would suffer in
every fibre of her being. It would be to her
like tearing her heart from her. And she would
suffer smiling, he knew that. That’s where the
pain would be the more intense. Those who can
bedew a wound with tears bring easing to its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>agony. And he told himself she would never shed
one tear. He knew he wasn’t being sentimental.
It was the hard bed-rock truth.</p>

<p>And the boys too! Antony, gay, debonair,
valiant little champion! Michael, a mere clinging,
cuddlesome baby! And there was Delancey Castle
before him in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Of course he didn’t know the place, he was
perfectly aware of that fact, but imagination could
well make up for lack of knowledge. In imagination
he saw the gardens, the terraces, the old grey
walls, the dark interior lit by diamond-paned
casement windows; he saw the blend of harmonious
colours; he smelt the old-time smell of century-mellowed
oak and leather, the fragrant scents of
lavender and <i>pot-pourri</i>. And it was this&mdash;this
absolutely perfect and fitting frame for that
adorable trio (he had forgotten Lady Mary for the
moment) that was to be snatched from them, and
made the frame for a modern, hustling, nasal-voiced
American.</p>

<p>“What do you think about it?” demanded John
sternly, his eyes towards the distant Castle, but
his words intended for the old priest.</p>

<p>“Sure, I was thinking every bit the same as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>you’re thinking, till twenty minutes or so agone,”
responded Father Maloney.</p>

<p>“And now?” demanded John.</p>

<p>“Glory be to God, is it a sermon you’re wanting?”
asked Father Maloney with a little twinkle in
his eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">CORIN THEORIZES</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Corin</span>, from the depths of one armchair, regarded
John in the depths of another.</p>

<p>“For sheer, racy, brilliant conversation commend
me to you,” he remarked sarcastically.
“For the last hour at least&mdash;I’ve had my eye on
the clock&mdash;you’ve uttered no single word. You’ve
rivalled the immortal William’s lover in your
sighs. Talk of <i>a</i> furnace, it’s like ten furnaces
you’ve been. Sigh, sigh, and again sigh. What’s
the matter with you, man? Is it love, sorrow, or
remorse for an ill-spent youth? Come, out with
it. Disburden your soul of the worm i’ the bud
which is feeding on your damask cheek. Speak,
I implore you.”</p>

<p>John roused himself.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he responded airily enough, “in the
matter of conversation I fancied we’d had enough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>of it at dinner&mdash;supper&mdash;whatever the original,
but wholly appetizing meal might be called. We
conversed pretty tolerably, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“Conversation!” Corin’s voice expressed a depth
of utter scorn. “Conversation! If that’s what he
calls the airy, frothy, soap-bubble words which fell
from his lips! Oh, you didn’t deceive me. I saw
in them the mere cloak to an aching heart. You
just over-did the lighthearted careless rôle.
You’ve said fifty times more in the last hour.
But now I want the translation, the interpretation.
Where’s the use of first frivolling, and then glooming?
Strike the happy medium. Come, consider
me a confidant,” he ended on a note of
coaxing.</p>

<p>John laughed. Then he relapsed into gloom,
frowning.</p>

<p>“It’s no laughing matter,” he said.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t I who laughed,” urged Corin gently.
“Come, tell me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said John stretching out his legs.
And forthwith he set himself to speak, succinctly,
concisely.</p>

<p>“Bless the man!” cried Corin at the end of the
recital, “so it’s that that’s weighing on his mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>“Well?” demanded John surprised, and not a
little injured. “And isn’t it enough to weigh on a
man’s mind? Isn’t it an entirely unparalleled
situation? Isn’t it an unthinkable, inconceivable
situation?”</p>

<p>Corin waved his cigarette in the air.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll grant you all that. But you’re too
susceptible. You’re too&mdash;too ultra-sympathetic.
It isn’t <i>your</i> Castle. It isn’t <i>your</i> relation that has
appeared unwanted from the other side of Nowhere.
It isn’t <i>you</i> who have got to take a back
seat and see Americans vault over your head
into the position you have just vacated.” He
stopped.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said John frigidly, “if that’s the
way you look at things.”</p>

<p>Corin sighed.</p>

<p>“It’s the only sensible way.”</p>

<p>“Hang sense,” muttered John.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” urged Corin soothingly,
“look at matters in a reasonable light. Here
are you sighing, frowning, suffering real mental
pain on behalf of a family&mdash;a quite picturesque
and interesting family, I’ve no doubt, but one
with which you have the barest bowing acquaintance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
the merest superficial knowledge. Your attitude
isn’t reasonable, it’s altogether exaggerated
and beside the mark.”</p>

<p>“It’s merely ordinary decent human sympathy,”
retorted John.</p>

<p>Corin raised his light arched eyebrows till they
nearly touched his light straight hair.</p>

<p>“Then,” he remarked coolly, “defend me
from your company when you are suffering
from extraordinary human sympathy. Seriously,
though,” he went on, “aren’t you being a trifle
<i>exalté</i> in the matter? Aren’t you plunging the
sword of sympathy a bit too deeply into your
heart? For a moment&mdash;just for one brief infinitesimal
moment&mdash;consider facts as they are. Here are
we two, dropped by the merest chance upon this
place, fallen upon it by the merest freak of fortune&mdash;three
weeks ago I’d never even heard of its
existence&mdash;and we’ve really no more individual
connection with it than with&mdash;with Mount Popocatepetl.
What possible reason, or, I might say,
what right or justification, has either one of us to
take to heart the private and personal trials of a
family living here. It’s&mdash;it’s almost an impertinence.
We aren’t in the picture at all. We’re
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>altogether superfluous to them. Look at the
whole thing from the point of view of an audience,”
continued Corin blandly. “A month
or two hence the curtain will have fallen on this
little drama, as far as we are concerned. We
aren’t on the stage at all.”</p>

<p>John smiled, a little grim smile, provoked, no
doubt, by the eminent common-sense of Corin’s
statement.</p>

<p>“You have a really wonderfully level way of
regarding matters,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it common-sense?” demanded Corin.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it’s common-sense right enough,”
conceded John airily.</p>

<p>“You see,” continued Corin, secretly immensely
pleased with what he considered the success of his
theorems, “you see it is absolutely and entirely
impossible for us as individuals to take to heart,
deeply to heart, each individual grief of each
individual person in the world. Consider, man,
if one did, every perusal of the daily papers would
be fraught with soul-agonizings, with horrible
heart-burnings. It would become a sheer wasting
of the nervous tissues, an utter and entire uneconomic
expenditure of the sympathies. Also,” concluded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span> Corin,
speaking now at top speed, “though
you, in your isolated superiority of an orthodox
religion, refuse to admit my theories, it is nevertheless
a fact that all suffering is the outcome of
justice, in a word, of karma, the inevitable demand
for the payment of those debts which every
individual has at one time or another voluntarily
contracted.”</p>

<p>John grinned.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that theory of yours before,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know your didymusical tendencies,”
retorted Corin.</p>

<p>John laughed.</p>

<p>“I should have supposed,” quoth he, “that the
shoe fitted another foot.”</p>

<p>But in his heart he was considering three points&mdash;three
questions raised by a previous speech in
the foregoing conversation. Firstly, was it a
mere freak of fortune that had brought him to
Malford? Secondly, would the curtain presently
fall on the drama so far as he was
concerned? Thirdly, had Father Maloney considered
his palpable sympathy in the business an
impertinence?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>To firstly and secondly his heart cried an
emphatic negative. Thirdly, after all, was a minor
consideration; but, having in mind Father Maloney’s
shrewd old eyes, John was disposed to
answer that question likewise in the negative.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">IN AN OLD CHURCH</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> next two days were <i>dies non</i> as far as John
was concerned, since never a glimpse did he obtain
of white-robed figure or attendant knights, despite
sun-baked rambles along dusty roads, deep lanes,
and over purple moorland.</p>

<p>He began to carp at that freakish sprite Chance.
Matters might have been so differently arranged
by him. Taking them in hand at all, they could
have been conceived with so infinitely greater
diplomacy. Where, after all, had been the use of
a mere goat? Why could not a bull&mdash;a ferocious,
snorting, pawing bull&mdash;have been brought on
to the stage. A bull must have entailed some
further acknowledgment of the heroic rescue.
He might even have been slightly injured in the
course of that same rescue. In that case inquiries
would have followed as a matter of course, maybe
even a visit of sympathetic and grateful condolence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>But a goat! a mere goat! With time and safety
in which to consider the situation, it had doubtless
presented itself to the lady’s mind as one of ridiculous
insignificance. Her alarm was, probably, by
now almost laughable in her own eyes; and, in the
face of this calm consideration, John’s advance to
the rescue would, therefore, have savoured somewhat
what of an intrusion. Verily had Chance been
freakish and ill-advised.</p>

<p>“Could I but build me a willow cabin at her
gates,” sighed John. “But to sit on the sun-baked
road would undoubtedly gain one the
reputation of a madman in these prosaic, self-contained
days.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless he wandered past those same
gates more times than I will venture to record, and
gazed ardently along the avenue of oaks and
beeches, but with no reward for his pains.</p>

<p>To bring solace to his soul, he bethought himself
of Sunday. Sight of her, at least, must be then
permitted him; speech with her, though a good
devoutly to be desired, was not probable of consummation.
Also, with distinct and genuine
success he interested himself in Corin’s labours.</p>

<p>The work in the church progressed. Daily the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>plaster fell before that remorseless chisel, daily
new delights shone forth to the light of day. The
tracery of the east window was uncovered; showing
brilliant blue-green, with glowing ruby eyes.
Great splashes of colour, bold yet simple outline,
transformed the dreary, hitherto plastered place
into a thing of mediæval beauty. The progress
of time vanished with the falling plaster. You
found yourself back in the old centuries, the dead
years revitalized.</p>

<p>John sought the church most willingly when the
workmen’s hours were over, when silence lay upon
the place, when the only sounds that came to him
were the falling of fragments from the walls, the
echo of Corin’s foot upon the plank as he shifted
his position, and the twittering and chirping of the
birds from the bushes in the sunny churchyard
without.</p>

<p>At such time imagination ran riot.</p>

<p>He pictured the village folk coming up the path
among the lengthening shadows, saw them entering
by the little Norman doorway, taking holy
water from the stoup, then kneeling before Christ
in the Blessed Sacrament. To him the church was
no longer an empty shell, but a place of crimson
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>draperies, dark oak pews, scattered shrines; with
here and there a kneeling figure; and above all,
superseding all, the quiet strength and peace of the
Hidden Presence.</p>

<p>Presently he began to individualize his village
folk. There was a fair-haired girl who came to
pray for her lover, to commend him specially to
Our Lord and St. Joseph, since he&mdash;her man&mdash;was
a carpenter. There was a dark-eyed woman who
came to plead for the life of her child lying sick
of a fever; there was a young man who came to
dedicate his youth and strength to God; and there
was an old, old woman, who, having no living to
pray for, came daily to pray for the holy dead.
The present had vanished, merged and absorbed
in the past. Despite all that has been lost,
removed, abandoned, despite the denial of entry
to that Gracious Presence, does there not still linger
in these old churches some faint sweet breath,
some hidden fragrance of that which once has
been?</p>

<p>You would never have imagined, seeing John
sitting there in his most immaculate suit of grey
flannels, that such thoughts as these were passing
through his mind. But I have observed, and you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>may take my observation for what it is worth,
that to attempt to guess at the minds of one’s
fellow humans by their clothes and their superficial
appearance, is a distinctly dangerous task.
To do so must inevitably result in a series of vast
surprises when the truth becomes known.</p>

<p>To my thinking it would be not unlike marching
into some great clothing emporium to examine
coats. There they hang,&mdash;tweed coats, frieze
coats, fur coats, silk coats, velvet coats, satin coats,
tinsel coats, even second-hand and shop-worn
coats. You turn them to look at the linings.
Now, here the shock begins. Where you expected
to find warm linings you find calico; where good
material, rags; where flimsy useless linings, cloth of
gold and soft fur; where soiled linings, the most
exquisite satins. Therefore, if you desire to make
a guess at the substance of these coats, without
actual knowledge of their linings, take them from
their peg and weigh them. A discrepancy between
their weight and your expectation of it may lead
you nearer a fair guess at the lining.</p>

<p>I’ll be bound, that, on mere superficial observation,
you’d have taken our John for a mere
summer coat of little substance and no weight; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>assuredly you’d find your mistake when you had
examined a bit closer. It is an idiosyncrasy of
human nature, perhaps intentional on the part of
the individual, perhaps unavoidable, that the vast
majority invariably deceives the casual observer.
No doubt this lends interest to our acquaintanceships
and friendships; often, too, lends disappointment;
and occasionally unexpected pleasure; but
interest certainly.</p>

<p>Here, however, I have advanced somewhat with
John’s meditations, carried them beyond those
first days of which I began to speak. Therefore
to return on our traces.</p>

<p>That first Saturday afternoon John, sitting on
an overturned wheelbarrow, began something of
those thoughts of which I have given you the
greater elaboration. I don’t believe for a moment
that he knew that he was thinking them. There’s
the curious joy of such thoughts. There is no
conscious effort on your part. You don’t map out
a route in your mind resolving your progress along
it, a conscientious observance of the milestones
you may pass. Insensibly you drift into peaceful
glades, silent and very sweet. Their atmosphere
steals upon you, holding your spirit in a breathless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>charm. Happiness, a strange wonderful happiness,
falls upon you. You accept it in its entirety,
taking, at the moment, no note of details. Later,
returning to more material consciousness and surroundings,
the details present themselves to your
memory, and you then realize your awareness of
them, even while they were submerged in the whole.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was cool in the church, in marked contrast
to the heat without. Being Saturday afternoon,
John and Corin had the place to themselves.
Corin, up aloft, chiselled with vigour, or with
suspended breath, as the exigencies of the work
demanded; John, on the overturned wheelbarrow,
was lost in thought.</p>

<p>Suddenly a slight sound made him raise his
head. For a moment, for one brief instant, he
still remained in the past, almost believing his
thoughts to have materialized before him.</p>

<p>In the shadow of the little Norman doorway
stood a white-robed figure. Still half dreaming he
looked to see her take holy water from the stoup.
Then actualities rushed upon him. His heart
jumped; pleasure, undeniable radiant pleasure,
shone from his face. He got to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“Oh,” said Rosamund perceiving him. And
she stopped, half hesitating.</p>

<p>John made her a little courtly bow.</p>

<p>“I thought,” said she smiling, “I should
have found the place deserted. It is Saturday
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“It is deserted,” John assured her, “but for
me and Corin.” He indicated the indefatigably
industrious figure aloft.</p>

<p>She smiled.</p>

<p>“I came,” said she, “with the intention of having
a private view, a little secret examination of
the paintings Mr. Elmore was uncovering.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said John. And then dubiously, “The
uncovered paintings are, as you see, at a goodly
height above us.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Her voice was regretful.</p>

<p>John heard the regret.</p>

<p>“I wonder&mdash;” he began.</p>

<p>“I <i>could</i>,” she assured him, with swift realization
of his unspoken thought.</p>

<p>He glanced towards the ladder.</p>

<p>“Really?” he queried.</p>

<p>She nodded. “Really. I am sure I could.”</p>

<p>“Come then,” said John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>They advanced towards the ladder. At the foot
thereof she paused.</p>

<p>“Shan’t we be disturbing him?” she queried.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” laughed John. “He’ll merely
be flattered at your interest. He’ll adore an
audience.”</p>

<p>The situation had for him the hint of an adventure.
To have told her curtly,&mdash;or suavely, for
that matter,&mdash;that it was impossible for her to see
those paintings would have resulted in her leaving
the church. There could have been no possible
excuse for her remaining. This thought justified
him in suggesting the venture. Naturally it
was an infinitely greater venture in his eyes than
in Rosamund’s. That is probably understood
without need of my mentioning the fact.</p>

<p>John, in advance, reached the first platform;
turned, took her hand firmly in his, and drew her to
safety. A second time was this feat accomplished
in like manner.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” exclaimed Corin, surprised at the
double apparition.</p>

<p>“Allow me,” said John, “to present my friend,
Mr. Elmore. Miss Delancey wanted to see the
paintings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>“Therein,” quoth Corin bowing, “she shows
her judgment. Behold!” He waved his chisel
towards the wall.</p>

<p>“Oh!” breathed Rosamund. Just that, and no
more.</p>

<p>Corin hugged himself with delight.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it gorgeous!” he ejaculated. “Isn’t it
superb, adorable, and dreamy! And heaven knows
what more this plaster hides. The unutterable
Philistines who smeared and daubed it over from
the light of day!”</p>

<p>“Is it not,” suggested Rosamund, “a matter for
thankfulness that they did merely smear and
daub? It is possible, it is quite conceivable, that
they might have scraped.”</p>

<p>Corin shuddered.</p>

<p>“Don’t suggest such a possibility,” he implored.
“I’ll confess my thankfulness for the daubing.”</p>

<p>She barely heard him. She was engrossed in
the work before her,&mdash;red, black, turquoise blue,
and crimson, she revelled in its colour. Daring
enough it was in parts, in others almost crude in its
simplicity. She was drawn, as John had been
drawn, back into the bygone ages. Their atmosphere
enfolded her, enwrapped her. She saw in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>the work before her, almost without realizing her
thoughts, the interpretation of the mind of the
painter. Here was nothing petty, nothing niggled;
it was frank, simple, childlike. It was extraordinarily
unselfconscious. Therein lay its subtle
charm. There was no intricacy of expression;
nothing laboured; almost, one might say, nothing
preconceived.</p>

<p>“Well?” queried John at last.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried, turning towards him, “it’s&mdash;it’s
so deliciously simple, so utterly unstudied.
It’s almost untutored in its crudeness, and yet&mdash;I
wonder wherein exactly the charm lies?”</p>

<p>“In its simplicity,” returned Corin promptly.
“Whoever painted this worked for pure pleasure.
There’s&mdash;well, there’s so extraordinarily little hint
of even the thought of an audience. Do you know
what I mean?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it,” she said laughing, “the entire expression
of ‘when the world was so new and all’?”</p>

<p>“<i>Exactly!</i>” cried Corin. “In those eight little
words Kipling carried us back into a clean fresh
world with its face all washed and smiling; when
we laughed for the mere joy of laughter; when
we wept if we wanted to weep&mdash;only I believe we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>didn’t want to; when the tiresome stupid phrases
‘What will people think? What will people
say?’ were unknown in the language; when we
danced, and ate, and played in the sunshine for
the mere joy of living.”</p>

<p>“Only that?” she queried, her eyebrows raised.</p>

<p>“Only that,” said Corin firmly. “Kipling is a
glorious pagan.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” She was dubious. “I wonder.”</p>

<p>“And this painter,” pursued Corin unheeding,
“splashed his colours on the walls, his blacks, his
reds, his blues, his lines and curves, and he laughed
as he worked, and I think he sang too, and he didn’t
care one jot what people thought about him or
his painting. He loved it, and so&mdash;” He broke
off with a gesture.</p>

<p>“But,” quoth she demurely, “I suppose you
don’t intend to infer that <i>he</i> was a pagan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can <i>call</i> him what you like,” returned
Corin magnanimously, “I only know that his mind
was as untrammelled as his work.”</p>

<p>“I see.” She shot him a little quizzical glance.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, standing once more on the
floor of the church, she said to John, smiling:</p>

<p>“I suppose Mr. Elmore considers your mind,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>and my mind, and, for the matter of that, the
mind of every Catholic in a kind of strait-jacket?”</p>

<p>“You’re not far beside the mark,” returned
John laughing.</p>

<p>He went with her to the door. A moment she
stood there; and, turning, looked back into the
church.</p>

<p>“After all, it’s sad,” she said.</p>

<p>“I know,” replied John.</p>

<p>“It’s&mdash;it’s the sense of loss.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said John again, “the sense of loss,
in spite of the faint fragrance that still lingers.”</p>

<p>She nodded, then turned towards the sunshine
without.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said she suddenly reminiscent,
“I left a note for you at the White Cottage. My
grandmother would be very pleased if you and Mr.
Elmore would lunch with us tomorrow at one
o’clock. She would like to thank you in person
for your intervention on our behalf the other day.
Can you come?”</p>

<p>“With the greatest pleasure in the world,”
returned John. And there is no question but that
his heart was in his voice.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WICKEDNESS OF MOLLY BIDDULPH</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">You</span> perceive, therefore, that Chance had truly
played the game well. John&mdash;a radiant John&mdash;apologized
within his soul for his one-time doubt
of the Sprite’s arrangement of affairs. The sun
immediately shone brighter, the sky was bluer,
the earth an altogether fairer and lovelier place.</p>

<p>He made his way swiftly back to the White
Cottage. There, in the parlour, he found what he
sought, a pale grey envelope lying on the table.
Quickly he broke the seal, perused the opening
words:</p>

<p>“My grandmother desires me....”</p>

<p>John’s heart thumped madly. It was exactly
as he had hoped,&mdash;her handwriting, her signature!
The faintest scent of lavender was wafted to him
from the paper.</p>

<p>“We shall be lunching at Delancey Castle
tomorrow,” said John, with a fine air of casualness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
to Mrs. Trimwell, who was setting out the
tea-things. Inwardly he was aware that an
almost idiotic smile of pleasure was wreathing
itself about his lips.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell beamed. You might have fancied,
seeing her, that the invitation had been extended
to herself.</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” said she, heartily and concisely.
“You need cheering up a bit.”</p>

<p>“I do?” John was surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mrs. Trimwell. “I’ve noticed
well enough that you’ve been down on your luck
like these last three days, and no wonder with not
a soul to speak to except Mr. Elmore, and him
everlasting on ladders chiselling of the walls,
which it isn’t the easiest way to be talking at the
same time, I’ll be bound. You’ve done nothing
but wear yourself out a-trapezing round the country
in the heat, and come home that tired you’ve
no stomach for your food. I’ve eyes in my
head.” Mrs. Trimwell nodded emphatically.</p>

<p>“Oh, but really&mdash;” began John feebly, and
with something like a queer sense of guilt, “I
haven’t&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’ve been dull,” reiterated Mrs. Trimwell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>firmly, “and if you <i>say</i> you haven’t you don’t
deceive me, no more than my Tilda did when she
come into the house half an hour agone looking for
all the world like a choir boy a-singing of hymns.
‘Where ha’ you been, Tilda?’ says I. Tilda, she
glinted at me out of the corner of her eye. ‘Oh,
round and about, mother,’ says she. ‘And ’tis
round and about with Molly Biddulph you’ve
been then,’ I says. And Tilda, she begins to snivel,
knowing I’ve told her times out of number I
won’t have her going around with Molly, who’s
the worst young limb of mischief to the village.
There’s nothing that child won’t do, from getting
unbeknownst into Jane Kelly’s shop and
changing the salt and sugar in the jars, to tampering
with the very books in the church itself.
Did I ever tell you about her and the banns
of marriage, sir?”</p>

<p>“You did not,” replied John.</p>

<p>“It was her cousin from Dublin what helped
her, I know,” announced Mrs. Trimwell, “being
a boy, and good at writing, and old enough to think
of the wickedness. But ’twas Molly stole the key,
as Father Maloney got her to own, and seeing
she goes to his church, being Irish papists, I wonder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>he don’t keep her in better order. Vicar, he was
away for a Sunday or two, and got another parson
what he called a lokomtinum to come down.
Molly, she stole the key of the vestry from Henry
Davies what’s the verger, and used to keep the key
in a china cat on his parlour mantelpiece, but has
carried it tied to his watch chain ever since, and her
and Patsie sneaked off down to the church when
Vicar had gone, and got the book of banns to be
called. There wasn’t but one bann to be called,
Lily Morton’s, her that married the blacksmith
over to Bradbury three months agone. Patsie
and Molly wrote down the rest. They coupled off
Mr. Healy and Miss Sweeting, and Mr. Porter
and Miss Janet Cray, and Mr. Lethbury and Miss
Martha Bridges, what’s all over fifty if they’re a
day, and the respectablest spinsters for miles
round, and Mr. Healey he’s in his dotage, and
Mr. Porter what’s afraid to look a woman in the
face, and Mr. Lethbury a married man with a wife
a bit of a termagent. They said afterwards&mdash;Molly
and Patsie&mdash;they had to give Miss Martha
Bridges to somebody, and there wasn’t no unmarried
men but Mr. Healey and Mr. Porter, and
they’d fixed them to Miss Sweeting and Miss Janet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>Cray. Well, the lokomtinum he don’t know
no more than Adam who the people in the village
are, and when it come to the banns, out he reads
the sinfulness them two have written down. Mrs.
Morton, the butcher’s wife, she was there, and
she told me afterwards you might ha’ heard the
gasp that went round the church up to the Castle.
Mr. Porter took and bolted, and hasn’t been seen
outside his gates yet. Mr. Healey wasn’t there,
and Mr. Lethbury he sat with his jaw dropped and
his eyes a-sticking out of his head. Miss Martha
Bridges had hysterics, and the only ones that
seemed a bit pleased and fluttery-like was Miss
Sweeting and Miss Janet Cray, specially Miss
Janet. Suppose them two thought it was a new
kind o’ way of proposing, not having the courage
to do it otherways.” Mrs. Trimwell stopped.</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked John trying to keep
his voice steady.</p>

<p>“Happened!” said Mrs. Trimwell. “There was
talk enough in the village that Sunday and a week
after to last most people for a lifetime and then
them feel a bit of chatterboxes. Henry Davies
he was mad, feeling responsible like as verger.
He guessed ’twas Molly at the bottom of it as she’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>at the bottom of all the mischievousness in the
place and her only eleven. But he couldn’t prove
nothing finding the key in the china cat Sunday
morning same as it always was, Molly having put
it back. He ask her, and she up and lied straight.
She’ll tell you a lie and look you in the face as
innocent as a dove. But I knows when she’s
lying for that she always turns her toes in when
she lies. But I don’t think other folk have
noticed that, and for all she’s a bad child I’ll not
give her away that much. Henry Davies he went
up to Father Maloney, and he sent for Molly and
Patsie, being a knowing man like, and the sinfulness
a bit beyond Molly’s years. They told him
the truth fast enough. I’ll say that for Molly, she
don’t never lie to Father Maloney, that I knows.
And then all they’d say, as brazen as you please,
was that they were sorry they couldn’t have heard
the banns read, because ’twould be a sin in them to
go to a Protestant church. Henry Davies said
Father Maloney was that angry with them for
such a speech he just turned his back straight
on them and walked over to the window. And
presently he said in a queer sort of voice that if
Henry Davies would go away for a bit he’d talk to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>Patsie and Molly. Henry Davies was sure he was
so upset at the wickedness of them being responsible
for their souls like that he couldn’t abide to
have any one see what he was feeling.”</p>

<p>“It would be a grief to him,” announced
John gravely. “Did&mdash;did his lecture have any
effect?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Trimwell, “in a manner of
speaking you might say it had. Father Maloney
went with Molly and Patsie to them six they’d
insulted&mdash;Father Maloney said ’twas an insult&mdash;and
to Henry Davies and the lokomtinum, and
they apologized. Though Molly said afterwards
that Miss Janet and the lokomtinum were the
only ones it had been worth while apologizing to.
She said it in Henry Davies’s hearing, which
it wasn’t pleasant for him to hear, and he’d have
gone to Father Maloney again but that Mrs.
Davies persuaded him to let well alone seeing he
might ha’ been a bit to blame for not keeping the
key safer. Father Maloney made them own up to
Vicar too, and say they were sorry. But sorriness
with Molly is water on a duck’s back and no more
and no less. And I’ve told my Tilda fifty times if
I’ve told her once, that I’ll not have her go with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>Molly. But it’s awful the way Molly gets a hold
on children with her coaxing ways.”</p>

<p>John shook his head in commiseration. Words,
it would appear, failed him at the moment.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, Mrs. Trimwell having departed,
he betook himself to a careful re-perusal
of that pale grey letter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">AT DELANCEY CASTLE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">“I saw</span> a new man in the park today.”</p>

<p>This statement, clear, emphatic, came from
Antony’s lips. Sheer courtesy had suppressed
it long enough to allow of Father Maloney’s
saying grace, then it had shot forth, somewhat
after the manner of a stone from a catapult.</p>

<p>The hour was one of the clock; the place was
the dining hall at Delancey Castle. John, on
entering it, had swept it with a comprehensive
glance. It was old-world, supremely, superbly
old-world. He had taken in the atmosphere in
one delicious draught.</p>

<p>It was a dark place, oak-panelled, yet, so he
assured himself, it was utterly devoid of grimness.
It was mellow, harmonious, softly shadowed.
High up on the oak walls, set against their darkness,
were splashes of colour,&mdash;shields of the houses
with which the Delanceys had married. Over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>the great fireplace was the Delancey shield itself,
<i>Arg. a pile azure between six and charged with
three escallops counterchanged</i>. The sunlight fell
through long casement windows, patterning the
floor with diamond-shaped splotches of gold.
At one end of the hall were two steps leading to
a little arched door. Through this you entered
the chapel. At the other end was the minstrels’
gallery. John could fancy it peopled with musicians,
heard in imagination the soft strains of
the harp and lute.</p>

<p>The table, uncovered, shone with the polishing
of generations; silver, glass, and red roses, were
reflected in its glossy surface. At one end sat
Lady Mary. Her white hair, covered with lace,
cobwebby, filmy, was backgrounded by the
darkness of her chair. Facing her was Rosamund,
white-robed, lovely, cordial. Opposite to John
was Corin flanked on either side by Antony and
Michael; on his right was Father Maloney.</p>

<p>To John’s mind, he and Corin alone brought the
twentieth century into the dark old place; yet,
bringing it, they failed to destroy the abiding
atmosphere. Of course the other five at the
table did not date back to their setting itself,&mdash;they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
were somewhere about eighteenth century
he conjectured,&mdash;but they linked on without a
break to the remoter ages; his thoughts ran
smoothly from them to the past. In a word,
they and their setting “belonged,” and that,
to him, summed up the whole essence of harmony.
He felt himself in a new old world,&mdash;new to him,
and yet old as Time itself. The day was centuries
old, caught out of the forgotten past, set down,
sweet, fragrant with memories, into the midst of
this twentieth century. And the twentieth
century with all its movement, with all its modern
innovations, fell away from him, dissolved,
vanished like fog wreaths before the sun.</p>

<p>“I saw a new man in the park today.”</p>

<p>The remark dropped into the harmony like a pebble
into a still lake. Why the simile presented itself
to his mind at the moment, John could not have told
you; nevertheless it did present itself.</p>

<p>“And what manner of man may a new man
be?” demanded Father Maloney.</p>

<p>Antony knitted his brows.</p>

<p>“Mr. Mortimer was a new man on Wednesday,”
quoth he serious. “Mr. Elmore is the newest of
all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>“Ah!” said Father Maloney, his eyes twinkling,
“now we see daylight. And what was this other
new man doing in the park at all?”</p>

<p>“I think,” quoth Antony solemn, “he was
trying to look at the Castle, but he didn’t want
any one to see him. Least I don’t think he did.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” said Father Maloney. “What makes
you think that?”</p>

<p>“’Cos,” said Antony calmly, “when I said
‘Hullo,’ he jumped an’ said ‘Great snakes!’
I told him,” he continued carefully, “that there
weren’t any snakes in the park. Least not big
ones anyway. An’ he said he hadn’t concluded
there were. He’d said ‘Great snakes!’ ’cos I
made him jump. S’pose it was same as Biddy
says ‘Saints alive!’ an’ you say ‘Glory be to
God!’”</p>

<p>Father Maloney looked down the table at Lady
Mary. The glance was a trifle grim.</p>

<p>“Did he say anything else?” asked Lady Mary
in a level voice.</p>

<p>“He asked me who I was. An’ I told him
my name was Antony Joseph Delancey. An’ he
said he reckoned I was the owner of the place.
An’ I said no, it was Granny’s place now, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>I was going to have it when I was a man. An’
he said, ‘Oh, you are, are you?’ An’ then he
whistled.”</p>

<p>There was a little curious silence. As we
calculate time it endured, perhaps, not longer
than two or three seconds, yet to John it seemed
interminable. It was broken by Antony’s voice,
pursuing his reminiscences the while he was
busy with roast chicken and bread sauce.</p>

<p>“He talked quite a lot,” pursued Antony,
cheerfully reflective. “He asked me how old
I was, an’ how long I’d lived here, an’ if I liked
it. An’ he wanted to know why we had a chapel
built on to the Castle, an’ he said he hadn’t been
inside a church for years, ’cos there weren’t any
churches where he lived, an’ when he came into
a town he felt like a fish out of water if he went
inside one. An’ he lives in a house that hasn’t
got any stairs, an’ there’s mountains round it,
an’ there’s baboons what come down from the
mountains to steal the mealies. Mealies are
Indian corn, he says. An’ he says lilies grow in
the ditches in his country, an’ great tall flowers
grow in his garden,&mdash;I don’t remember the name,&mdash;an’
wild canaries fly about among them. An’ he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>says the sunshine out there is all hot an’ gold,
an’ the shadows are blue as blue. An’ he says
we don’t know what sunshine is in England, ’cos
even when it’s sunny it’s like a gauze veil hung
over the sun. An’ he’s shot leopards, an’ little
tiny deer, an’ killed big snakes. An’ he asked me
honest injun what I thought about him, an’ I
said I liked him. An’ he said perhaps I wouldn’t
like him very long. An’ I said ‘Why?’ An’ he
laughed, an’ shook hands, an’ went away. An’
that,” concluded Antony with satisfaction, “is
all.”</p>

<p>Again there fell a little silence. It was probably
infinitely more poignant to John than to the other
members of the luncheon table. That is the
worst of being possessed of a sensitive and imaginative
temperament. Your suffering is invariably
duplex. You suffer for yourself and the other,
or others, as the case may be. And, in suffering
for others, your imagination, as often as not,
passes the bounds of actualities, for the very
excellent reason that you possess no real knowledge
to bring it to a halt.</p>

<p>Corin, though certainly less imaginative, felt
the slight tension. He leaped to break it, in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>manner highly praiseworthy, if slightly abrupt.
What his remark was precisely, John did not
fully grasp, but it certainly had his work in the
church for a foundation. The leap taken, he
burbled joyously, expounding, theorizing. There
was no egotistical note in his expounding. After
all, as he assured them, the work was not his.
He was, in a manner of speaking, but a digger, a
scraper. The fact left him free to be enthusiastic
at will, and enthusiastic he veritably was.</p>

<p>Possibly mere politeness first urged three of the
elder members of the party to suitable rejoinders.
I omit John from the number. Later they may
have been fired by Corin’s exceeding enthusiasm.
Be that as it may, the tension was distinctly
relieved. Conversation flowed easily, smoothly.
Dessert had been reached before it was suddenly
jerked back to dangerous quarters.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Antony, surveying a bunch
of raisins on his plate, “who he is?” There
was, you can guess, no need for a more detailed
explanation.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Lady Mary quietly, “it was
Sir David Delancey.”</p>

<p>It was out now. The words were spoken.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>To John, they somehow struck the last nail in
the coffin of his hopes.</p>

<p>“Same name as us?” queried an astonished
Antony.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Lady Mary.</p>

<p>“I liked him,” said Antony cheerfully. “Do
you s’pose he’s staying here? Do you s’pose
I shall see him again?”</p>

<p>John caught his breath. Once more there was
the fraction of a pause, a little tense silence.</p>

<p>Then came Lady Mary’s well-bred voice.</p>

<p>“I think you will see him again. I shall ask
him to come and see the Castle before long.”</p>

<p>John looked up, amazed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">A POINT OF VIEW</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">“Of</span> course,” said John to himself, “I see her
point of view.”</p>

<p>It was, be it stated, at least the fiftieth time in
the course of the last four and twenty hours that
he had assured himself of the perspicacity of his
vision. Also, it must be observed, it was because
his own point of view was so diametrically opposed
to hers that he found the assurance necessary.
It emphasized, in a measure, his own broadness
of mind, his ability to perceive another’s standpoint
even while he disagreed with it <i>in toto</i>.
You will doubtless have observed this attitude
of mind in such persons as are fully determined
to adhere to their own opinions.</p>

<p>Of course he realized Lady Mary’s point of
view, her quixotic determination to recognize
the interloper as one of the family, now that his
claim to recognition had been fully established.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>Of course it was noble, chivalrous, Christian to a
very fine degree of nicety; but it was, to John’s
way of thinking, ultra-quixotic, unnecessary,
save to aspirers after saintship. And John, from
a delightfully human standpoint, saw no reason
to imagine Lady Mary as an aspirer to this exalted
degree of perfection. Therefore, from a human
standpoint, her determination was tinged, distinctly
tinged, with absurdity.</p>

<p>It was one thing, argued John, to bear a treacherous
dog’s bite with courage and equanimity, it
was quite another to welcome and caress the dog
that has bitten you. There was treachery,
unfairness, in the whole business as far as the
interloper was concerned; that fact made John’s
point of view the justifiable, and, indeed, the
only sane one. He saw precisely how he would
have acted in the matter. He would have given
a dignified refusal to permit the interloper to
put so much as his nose inside the Castle, till such
time as he himself and his belongings had made
a dignified exit from it. There was dignity enough
in John’s attitude, you may be sure. In fact it
was a dignity which, for the time being, entirely
overrode his quite abundant sense of humour.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>Therefore, you perceive, that the dignity was
coloured by a very decided sense of ill-temper.
This last quality and self-appreciation&mdash;and
I believe our John was modest enough&mdash;alone
are capable of subordinating such humour.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said John again, “I see her point
of view, but it’s such a confoundedly quixotic
one. It isn’t level; it isn’t sane; it&mdash;it won’t
work.” And then John frowned fiercely, and
gazed glumly before him.</p>

<p>He was sitting in the shadow of a haystack,
the afternoon being intensely hot. The sleepy
air was curiously still. Had John not been entirely
engrossed in his own reflections, it is possible
he might have read something ominous in this
stillness. It is certain that he would have done
so had he looked past the haystack behind him,
and seen the purple-black clouds gradually massing
up on the distant horizon. Before him,
however, all was serene, sunny, and drowsy;
therefore he continued to dream.</p>

<p>His thoughts leaving, for a time at least, a
subject at once unfruitful and irritating, they
rambled over the incidents of the last few days.
Undercurrently, as a kind of connecting link
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>to the scattered beads of incident, was a half-wondering
reflection on the inscrutable leadings
of Fate, Providence,&mdash;call it what you will. And
if it wasn’t Fate which had led him here, it was
Providence, and if it was Providence there was
no gainsaying the plan, and so&mdash;and so&mdash; He
broke off.</p>

<p>Oh, he’d follow up the leading fast enough.
It was his one whole and sole desire. Hadn’t
he had this desire for months past? Hadn’t it
been his one dream since five minutes to four
precisely one windy March afternoon? He’d
follow hot afoot fast enough. The whole question
was, Would she come the merest fraction of a
step towards him? Would she even pause to
await his coming? Or would he come to the end
of the pathway to find that she had eluded him,&mdash;a
locked gate the end of his quest? And there
must be no stumbling, no clumsy blundering on
that pathway. Despite his desire for swiftness,
he must walk warily. And then his thoughts
came to a halt, overcome, I fancy, by some suspicion
of their presumption. For a moment
he staggered mentally, yet but for a moment.
Courage called high-handed to his heart. “On,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>man, and take the risk,” she cried. “Cowardice
and false modesty never yet led to a fair goal.”</p>

<p>Now his thoughts went back slowly step by
step, dwelling with interest on each little incident
that had brought him to his present vantage
point. It being a vantage point, this method
of thought had its fascination. It was pleasant
enough to give mental fingering to each little
bead of incident, to marvel at their connection
with each other. Truly there are times when
such a process brings pain, when each bead will
hold a tiny poisoned prick. But why think of
such times? To John, each bead was carved in
happiness.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, he was aware that the
physical sunshine around him had dimmed.
Glancing upwards he saw the edge of a dark
cloud. He got to his feet and came out from the
shelter of the haystack.</p>

<p>Rolling up from the westward, thunderous,
leaden, were great massive clouds. The air
below was extraordinarily still; he was aware
now of something electric in its stillness. Overhead
there was unquestionably wind, since the
clouds rolled up and spread with rapidity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>“We’re in for a deluge,” said John, making
for the high road.</p>

<p>It led downhill, straight, dusty, and very white,
flanked on either side by high hedges, dust-sprinkled.
John made his way down it at a fine
pace. A thin flannel suit would be poor enough
protection against the torrent that was at hand.</p>

<p>Nearing the bottom of the hill, he heard the
sharp ting of a bicycle bell behind him. The next
instant the bicycle and its rider flashed past.</p>

<p>“Crass idiot to ride at that pace,” ejaculated
John against the hedge. The machine had been
within a couple of inches of his arm.</p>

<p>And then came the first drops of rain, splashing
down, splotching dark spots on the dusty road.
White a moment agone, in a second it was brown.
The rain hissed down upon the earth. Truly
there was the sound of its abundance.</p>

<p>John took to his heels and ran. As he turned
at the bottom of the hill, he came to a sudden
halt. By the roadside, half sitting, half lying,
was a man; a bicycle, wheels in the air, reposed
disconsolately in a ditch.</p>

<p>“Hurt?” demanded John as he came abreast
of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“Twisted my ankle,” was the laconic response.</p>

<p>John glanced along the road. A hundred
yards or so ahead, through the downpour, he
could see the White Cottage.</p>

<p>“I can give you an arm to shelter if you can
manage to hobble,” he announced, indicating
the house.</p>

<p>The man scrambled to his feet with a grimace
of pain. Together, in halting fashion, they made
their way towards the cottage. Conversation
there was none. John expressed a consolatory
remark or two at intervals, to which his companion
replied, “All right. Not much. Brake
broke,” as the case might be.</p>

<p>Even in these few words there was something
in the inflexion of his voice which perplexed John.
Undercurrently he found himself demanding
what it was, but the exigencies of the moment
disallowed of the query coming uppermost. Also,
at the moment, John happened to be suffering
from one of those lapses into obtuseness to which
even the most intelligent of us are liable on
occasions.</p>

<p>It was with a sigh of relief that he pushed open
the door of his sitting-room.</p>

<span class="smaller">JOHN PLAYS THE SAMARITAN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">There</span> is no question but that Mrs. Trimwell could
rise to an emergency when it presented itself
before her. In fifteen, perhaps no more than
ten, minutes from their entry, she had the
drenched couple into dry garments; the injured
ankle was bound in soft bandages, tea was in
preparation.</p>

<p>But why, marvelled John, should her beneficent
services have been dispensed with a face as sour as
a crab-apple? Why should her whole mien have
been as stiff, unbending, and unyielding as the
proverbial poker? The disapproval of her attitude
was so marked as to be impossible to ignore.
John, in the position of host, felt some sort of an
apology necessary. Mrs. Trimwell departed, he
stumbled one forth, wondering, as he endeavoured
at lightness, whether he were not, after all, a bit of
a fool for his pains; whether, by remarking on her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>taciturn grimness, he were not emphasizing it
more crudely.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t mean to be abrupt,” he concluded,
holding his cigarette case towards the
stranger.</p>

<p>The man took a cigarette, and glanced at John.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I guess she does,” he remarked
drily.</p>

<p>John looked at him. Obtuseness still had him
in her clutch.</p>

<p>“She knows who I am,” said the man coolly,
“and&mdash;well, I fancy most folk round here are not
predisposed in my favour. My name, by the
way, is David Delancey.”</p>

<p>John gasped, frankly gasped. He was amazed,
dumbfounded. Running through the amazement
was, I fancy, something like annoyance; though
superseding it was a sense of the ludicrous, a
realization of the absurdity of the situation.
And this brought him to something perilously
near a titter.</p>

<p>The man looked at him.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said deliberately, though with
a gleam of amusement in his own eyes, “if you feel
the same way about things, I’ll move on now.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>I’ll make shift to hobble to the inn if you’ll lend
me a couple of sticks.”</p>

<p>John experienced a sudden sensation of shame.
Perhaps it was by reason of the quick interpretation
of his unspoken thoughts, perhaps it was
something in the other’s steady grey eyes.</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the kind,” he said quickly.
And then he laughed.</p>

<p>“What’s funny?” demanded David.</p>

<p>“Oh, the whole blessed kaboodle,” returned
John, still laughing softly. “Here was I half an
hour agone inveighing against you for all I was
worth, and now&mdash;well, the rôle of good Samaritan
strikes me as a bit humorous, that’s all.”</p>

<p>He held a lighted match towards his guest.
David took it. After a moment he spoke.</p>

<p>“Then you know them up at the Castle?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said John.</p>

<p>David glanced at him, then turned to a contemplation
of his cigarette.</p>

<p>“I had a note from the old lady today,” he said
ruminatively. “She has asked me to dine on
Thursday. Now, I call that sporting of her.
I guess I’d be more like sticking a knife into me
than asking me to share her salt. It’s the way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>she’s worded the note, too, that I’m stuck on.
I’d give a good many dollars to get my tongue
and pen around words in that fashion. I reckon
I shall shake hands with her cordially.”</p>

<p>John eyed him curiously. His preconceived
notions of hostility were undergoing an extraordinary
change, a change at once rapid, and,
to him, amazing, incomprehensible. I fancy he
tried to rein them back, to bring them to a standstill,
while he took a calmer survey of the situation,
but, for all his endeavours, he found they had
suddenly got beyond his control.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” hazarded he, “if you’d mind my
asking you something. What gave you the first
clue&mdash;the idea of starting out on this quest of
yours?”</p>

<p>“The clue?” David laughed. “It’s a bit of a
yarn, I can tell you. You want it? Sure?”</p>

<p>John nodded.</p>

<p>“Well,” quoth David, “you can call it luck,
chance if you like. We’ve always known we
hailed as a family originally from England. That
knowledge has been handed down to us as a bit of
tradition. I was born in Philadelphia, and riz
there, as they say in the States, till I was going
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>ten. Then my father made for Africa. There’s
no need to enter into the details of that move;
they’re beside the mark. He took a small farm in
the Hex River Valley. He had a few old things
that belonged to his father and grandfather
before him. They were stored away in a chest.
I used to look inside it when I was a youngster,
and see coats, and waistcoats, and neck
stocks, and a fusty old book or two lying in it.
I never smell camphor without thinking of that
chest.</p>

<p>“As I grew older, I left it alone, didn’t think
about it. I guess my father hadn’t bothered
about it much more than I did. He died when
I was fifteen, and my mother ran the farm. She
was a capable woman. I helped her all I could,
and there were men to do the work. But she was
boss till I was one and twenty. Then she turned
it over to me to run,&mdash;root, stock, and barrel.
She was cute, though, the way she’d talk things
over with me, telling me all the time what was
best to do, and making me think that I had figured
out the plans. Later on she left it really to me,
not just in the name of it. That was when I’d
got the right hang of things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“Then she dropped suddenly out of all the man
way of thinking, and just sat knitting and smiling
in the chimney corner, or letting me drive her
around in the buggy, with never a talk of business
unless I began the subject. It’s seven years ago
that she died.” He stopped.</p>

<p>John was silent.</p>

<p>“I missed her,” went on David presently, “I
missed her badly. The place wasn’t the same.
I went roving around trying to think she wasn’t
gone&mdash;but I’ll get maudlin if I go on with that.
It wasn’t the bit I set out to tell you, anyway.
One afternoon I was in the lumber room feeling
lonesomer than ever. I don’t know what took me
there if it wasn’t just fate. Then I looked at
that chest again. I opened it, and the smell of
camphor rushed out at me, making me think more
than ever of my mother. She was mad after
camphor, putting it among everything to keep
away the moth.</p>

<p>“To get away from my thoughts I began pulling
out the things in the box, stuffy books, coats,
waistcoats, and all. There was one coat, a snuff-coloured
one, that might have been worn in the
time of the Georges, I calculated. I sat looking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>at it, and wondering which of my grandparents had
worn it, and what kind of a man he was, and all
the things a fellow does think when he’s got his
grandsire’s stuff before him. After a bit I began
going through the pockets. I found a tiny horn
snuff-box in one, and that set me off searching
closer. I’d come to the last pocket, when I found
what gave me that clue you were asking about. I
found a letter.”</p>

<p>John looked up quickly.</p>

<p>“It was torn, and not over-easy to read,” went
on David. “I’ve got it here. You can read it if
you like.”</p>

<p>He felt in his waistcoat pocket and pulled out
his pocket-book. From it he took a letter.</p>

<p>John took the yellow paper with its faded ink
lines. As he touched it he thought of the queer
twists fate gives to the wheel of our life. Less
than a fortnight ago he had set eyes but momentarily
upon one of the Delancey family,
and now here he was, thrown into their midst,
made participator even in their extraordinary
history. It was, so mused John, a bit of a
marvel.</p>

<p>Here is the letter he read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">“<span class="smcap">My dear son Richard</span>:</p>

<p>“I am about to set forth on the journey of
which you know the purpose. If I am successful
you will claim your birthright. Though I sold
mine, after the manner of Esau, for a mess of red
pottage, being forced thereto by harshness, yet I
forfeited it for myself alone.</p>

<p>“Your mother and brother do not know of the
purpose of my journey to England. I think it
well that it should remain known to us two alone
till my return.</p>

<p class="right">“Your affectionate father,</p>

<p class="right2">“<span class="smcap">Henry Delancey</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>John slowly deciphered the faint lines. Silently
he tendered the letter again.</p>

<p>“It set me thinking,” said David reminiscently.
“I was in that lumber room for more than two
hours reading that letter again and again. It was
clear that there was something belonging to us
that we hadn’t got; something that, as far as I
could see, we had the right to have, though I
didn’t just know what it was. It struck me as
queer that the Richard who had had the letter
hadn’t had a try for it. I know now that he died
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>of some kind of fever after his father had been
gone six weeks. His father didn’t return.”
David’s voice was grim.</p>

<p>“I know,” said John.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard the story?” demanded David.</p>

<p>“That part of it. But go on.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued David, “whether no one else
knew of the letter, or whether they thought that
trying for their rights was a fool game, I don’t
know. There were times when I was after it that I
thought it a fool game myself. But I’d set out on
it, and somehow I never find it easy to turn back
on any job I’ve set out on. If the others didn’t
think our birthright worth a bit of a fight I did. It
took me five years to trace up the family, but I got
on the track, back to the certificate of Henry
Delancey’s marriage to Marie Courtoise, daughter
of a Brussels lace merchant. It was their grandson
who first settled in the States. With that
I came to England, and followed up the clue here.
Then I understood exactly what I was after. They
can’t deny that Henry was the eldest son, and
though they say he signed away the property from
himself and his heirs they haven’t got that document.
This letter, too,” he tapped it gently,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>“shows that though he may have signed it away
from himself, he did not touch the birthright of his
heirs. See?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see,” returned John a trifle drily.</p>

<p>Oh, he saw fast enough. Also, he saw pretty
plainly that Henry Delancey had been no fool
in the game of swindling.</p>

<p>David looked at him.</p>

<p>“You’re on the side of the occupants of the
Castle,” he said. It was statement rather than
query.</p>

<p>“I am,” said John coolly. His eyes held something
of a challenge.</p>

<p>“Hum,” remarked David.</p>

<p>And then Mrs. Trimwell entered with the tea,
and an aspect of rigid disapproval.</p>

<span class="smaller">CORIN DISCOURSES ON KARMA</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">“I like</span> that man,” announced Corin succinctly.</p>

<p>John grunted.</p>

<p>“I like him,” announced Corin again, stirring
his coffee.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard you make that remark at least
ten times since his departure,” quoth John, and
somewhat sarcastically, be it stated.</p>

<p>“It is possible,” returned Corin coolly, “that
you will hear me make it at least ten times more.
Of course I’ll allow that he isn’t in the picture. In
fact he’s entirely out of the picture; he strikes an
incongruous note. It requires a readjustment of
all one’s preconceived notions to see him in that
old-world setting up yonder.”</p>

<p>John groaned inwardly.</p>

<p>“Yet you cannot deny,” pursued Corin, “that
there is a pleasing strength and virility about him.
I had allowed myself to imagine him as a small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>hustling man, a cross between the brisk commercial
traveller and the hard-headed mechanic,
with perhaps a touch of the oily waiter thrown
in. And now,” went on Corin musingly, “I perceive
that he is a big man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Your eyesight would be strangely deficient if
you didn’t perceive it,” broke in John.</p>

<p>“A silent man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He hadn’t a chance of getting a word in edgeways
when you appeared upon the scene,” interpolated
John.</p>

<p>“A thoughtful man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is to be hoped he was able to assimilate a
few of the thoughts you thrust down his throat,”
quoth John grimly.</p>

<p>“Hang the stupid little complications of life,”
he was thinking. There was a tiny note of trouble
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“If you mean that I thrust my ideas upon him
unwanted,” said Corin with dignity, “allow me to
remark that you are mistaken. I observed interest,
intelligent interest, in his face.”</p>

<p>“And you pretend to being short-sighted,”
interposed John.</p>

<p>“The idea,” continued Corin, “of his having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>worked out his debt of karma for sins committed
in former lives, and being, therefore, now able to
enter upon his birthright, appealed to him. It
distinctly appealed to him. He said, ‘I guess
that’s a new handle to take hold of,’ more than
once.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t say it was an inviting one,”
retorted John.</p>

<p>“I’m a fool to be worried about such a trifling
absurdity,” he thought.</p>

<p>“There is much,” said Corin didactically, “that
is uninviting at the outset, but which, on further
acquaintance, proves of extraordinary interest.
Also, for my part, rather let me grasp Truth however
uninviting she may appear, than dally with
the most pleasing of lies.”</p>

<p>John laughed.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” went on Corin, “what precise debt
of karma the family at the Castle owes this man,
that he is to be the instrument for their unseating.”</p>

<p>“According to you,” returned John, “since he
has paid off his own debt, and gained reward, he
is obliged to unseat someone.”</p>

<p>Corin sighed.</p>

<p>“I fear,” he said, “that I shall never be able
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>to make you perceive the law and order, the strict
justice in the universe. If reward is gained at the
expense of another, it is merely because that other
deserves that the reward should be so gained.”</p>

<p>John laughed a second time. Argument in this
quarter was futile, and he knew it. His friendship
with Corin was always a matter of some slight
amusement and puzzlement to him, when he
chanced to consider the subject. It is certainly
somewhat difficult to conceive wherein precisely
the attraction between them existed, having in
view their diametrically opposite opinions.</p>

<p>“Confound the man,” thought John, and it was
not on Corin those thoughts were centred, “why
couldn’t he have been all that I had pictured
him?”</p>

<p>“You can laugh,” said Corin severely, “but it is
very certain that you can bring no arguments
to refute mine.”</p>

<p>“My dear man,” responded John, “I could bring
twenty million, but it’s like pouring water into a
sieve to propound them to you. I believe I have
heard a tale of a monk being once sent by a saint
to fetch water in a sieve; and when, at the end of
several journeys, he ventured to remonstrate at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>the futility of the journey, it was pointed out to
him that at all events the sieve had been cleansed
by the process. I don’t know whether my arguments
would have a like effect on your mind, but
I confess I am too lazy to try.”</p>

<p>“Your simile savours of an insult,” retorted
Corin. “But I’ll leave you to your own mode of
thought. I know it to be hide-bound, iron-cast.
Now, in this man I see plastic material; he needs
but careful moulding. I shall pursue my acquaintance
with him with interest.”</p>

<p>John laughed a third time. But behind the
laughter in his eyes was still that little indefinable
note of trouble.</p>

<span class="smaller">A RARE ABSURDITY</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Now</span>, to your calm, collected, and reasonable
individual, John’s little trouble may appear
nothing but rank absurdity. It probably will
appear nothing but rank absurdity, seeing that it
had existence merely in the fact that he had felt a
certain attraction towards the man, whom fate had
that evening thrown in his path.</p>

<p>And why on earth shouldn’t he feel attraction!&mdash;so
your reasonable individual may exclaim.</p>

<p>But John was not reasonable. He was one of
your ultra-sensitive characters, to whom the merest
dust speck may prove, at moments, a source of
perpetual annoyance. He desired to feel nothing
but a whole-hearted detestation of this interloper.</p>

<p>I am not defending John’s desires,&mdash;they certainly
cannot be termed precisely Christian,&mdash;I
merely state them as existing. Their fulfilment
would have left him entirely free to draw a line
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>between himself and the one who had arisen to
harass the inhabitants of Delancey Castle. He
would have felt utterly and entirely established
beside them. He was established beside them,
yet this tiny attraction sent forth an irritating
little lay across the barrier. He felt it, in a
measure, disloyal. He disliked it; and yet, for the
life of him, he could not prevent its existence.</p>

<p>I am well aware of the absurdity of his annoyance;
but it merely characterizes John. It shows
him to be what he was,&mdash;ultra-quixotic in his
friendships, sensitive to a degree of fastidiousness
where he fancied his loyalty to be in the smallest
measure at fault.</p>

<p>Not that John was blind to the imperfections
of his friends (and here I use the word in its full
meaning),&mdash;those few&mdash;they were few&mdash;whom
he had admitted, or who had somehow found
entrance, to the inner shrine of his heart. But I
could fancy him shielding those imperfections from
the eyes of the world with his own body; standing
between them and the gaze of a curious multitude;
suffering death, if need be, in the shielding.</p>

<p>Call him absurd, if you will; but, for my part, I
like this rare absurdity.</p>

<span class="smaller">IN FATHER MALONEY’S GARDEN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Father Maloney</span> was pottering in his garden. I
use the word pottering advisedly, since assuredly
the cutting off of a dead rose here and there can
hardly be termed work.</p>

<p>It was a minute place, this garden of his, a mere
pocket handkerchief of a garden, yet every conceivable
flower possible to bloom in a garden
bloomed in it according to the season. At the
moment it was ablaze with African marigolds,
escoltia, asters, salvias, stocks, summer chrysanthemums,
and all the rest of the August flowers,
fragrant with the scent of roses, heliotrope, carnations,
and mignonette.</p>

<p>In the centre of the garden was a tiny square of
grass, smooth and trim. A gravel path surrounded
it; beyond it were the many-coloured flower
borders backgrounded by a close-clipped yew
hedge. You could see over the hedge to the lane
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>on the one side, and the field on the other. The
field sloped upwards to a sparse wood, carpeted
with primroses and bluebells in the springtime.
Later there was a lordly array of foxgloves on its
margin, stately purple fellows, standing straight
against the trees.</p>

<p>Beyond the lane and the wild-rose hedge, which
bordered it on the further side, you had a glimpse
of the sea. Its voice was never absent from the
garden. In its softly sighing moods it lay as an
under-note to the fragrant scents, and the humming
of the insects. In its sterner moods it dominated
the little place, filled it with a note of
sadness. And always there was that strange
bitter-sweetness in its sound.</p>

<p>Father Maloney was conscious of it now. He
looked up from the rosebush towards the distant
shimmering strip of blue.</p>

<p>“’Tis like the far-off voice of a multitude longing
for peace yet unknowing of their desire,” he
said, “it is that.” And there was pain in his old
eyes.</p>

<p>Then he looked round the garden.</p>

<p>“Sure, ’tis happy I’ve been here; and now&mdash;”
he sighed. “The fella is no Catholic at all, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>say. But if he were it would not be the same
thing, it would not.”</p>

<p>He cut off a couple more roses, and pocketed
them. Later Anastasia would empty his pockets
of the dead leaves. Also she would suggest&mdash;more
as a command than a suggestion&mdash;that there
were plenty of baskets in the house if he wanted
to be cutting off withered roses and suchlike. To
which Father Maloney would make his usual
shame-faced reply:</p>

<p>“Sure, and a basket slipped my mind entirely, it
did.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Anastasia would sniff. By force of
habit she had gained a certain air of command,
which most assuredly he did not permit to many.</p>

<p>“She’s an example to all of us, is Lady Mary,”
said Father Maloney, pursuing his reflections.
“It’s more than I would do to invite the fella
to the house. It’s not uncharitable towards
him, I am, but he’d not put his foot across
my threshold till I’d cleared out. No; it’s not
uncharitable I am, but I’ll have a job to be civil
to him I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>He stuffed a handful of dead roses into his
pocket, and sat down on a rustic-seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>It was three of the afternoon. It was still;
it was very hot. If I have often mentioned heat
in the course of this chronicle, I must crave for
indulgence. An almost unprecedented summer
was reigning over this England of ours. Morning
after morning you woke to blue skies and golden
sunshine; night after night you slept beneath
clear heavens star-sprinkled. Day and night the
earth sang the Benedicite; and men, I fancy, echoed
the blessings. In spite of the inclusive terms
of the hymn, it is infinitely easier to respond
to it in sunshine and starlight, than in fog and
darkness.</p>

<p>Father Maloney sat facing the lane and the distant
strip of sea. Two poplars in the field across
the lane rose spirelike against the blue sky. Bees
droned around him among the flowers; butterflies
flitted from blossom to blossom. Every now and
again a bird twittered and then was silent. Their
song was over for the year. Only the robin would
ring later its sweet sad lament.</p>

<p>Through the open kitchen window he heard
the clink of plates, telling of Anastasia busy within.
At intervals she hummed in a thin cracked
voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p class="center no-indent">“<i>Salve Regina, Mater Misericordiæ, vita, dulcedo,
et spes nostra salve,...</i>”</p>

<p>You could have recorded each of the Church’s
seasons by Anastasia’s humming of the antiphons
of Our Lady. At first Father Maloney had suffered
the humming with what patience he might.
It now affected him no more than the droning of
the bees in his garden.</p>

<p>For twenty minutes, half an hour, perhaps, he
sat motionless, his thoughts very far away. Suddenly
he came back to the present. He was
conscious, in some subtle fashion, that he was
not alone. It was a moment or so before the
consciousness found articulation in his brain. He
looked up. The garden was as empty of any
human presence but his own as it had been hitherto.</p>

<p>He turned.</p>

<p>In the field, on the other side of the yew
hedge, a tall man was standing. He was big, he
was loose-limbed, he was red-headed. His face,
squarish and short-chinned, had a somewhat
doggy expression. He was looking at the flowers,
seemingly unconscious, for the moment at all
events, of the presence of the owner of the garden.</p>

<p>Father Maloney coughed. The stranger’s eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>left the flowers, and turned towards Father
Maloney.</p>

<p>“I was looking at the flowers,” quoth he, and a
trifle shame-facedly, after the manner of a schoolboy
caught in some venial offence.</p>

<p>“You’re welcome,” said Father Maloney genially.
“Looking is free to all.” And then a
sudden idea struck him, and he stiffened imperceptibly,
or perhaps he fancied it was imperceptibly,
for the stranger spoke.</p>

<p>“I’ll be off,” said he. “I didn’t mean to disturb
you.”</p>

<p>A little odd shadow had passed over his face,
the expression of a child who has been snubbed.
It sat oddly, and a trifle pathetically on him. He
turned, limping slightly.</p>

<p>“It’s not disturbing me at all you are,” said
Father Maloney quickly. The honour of his
hospitality had been pricked. The merest touch
will suffice for an Irishman.</p>

<p>And then he looked at the stranger again.
There was an odd commotion stirring in his
heart, something that baffled him in its interpretation.</p>

<p>“Glory be to God, what’s come over me,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>he muttered inwardly. Aloud he said, and the
words surprised himself, “Will you be coming in,
and having a look around. There’s a wicket gate
in yonder corner.”</p>

<span class="smaller">A BEWITCHING</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">If</span> this&mdash;his own voluntary invitation&mdash;had surprised
Father Maloney, twenty minutes later he
was more surprised still. His mind was in one
chaotic state of surprise. It had entirely lost its
bearings; it had drifted into an extraordinary
geniality with, apparently, no volition on his own
part. As surely as he contracted it momentarily
into a state of astonished frigidity, so surely it expanded,
thawed again, into an altogether untoward
hospitality.</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s entirely bewitched I am,” he muttered
sternly, bewildered at one moment, and the next
expatiating on the individual beauties of some
rose, as a mother expatiates on the virtues of her
child, provided, of course, that her audience be
sufficiently sympathetic.</p>

<p>“’Tis in June you should have been seeing
them,” he said at length, tenderly fingering a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>Madame Abel Chatenay, salmon pink, pale, and
graceful, “’tis in June you should have been seeing
them. For every one rose on the bushes now,
there were ten then. Sure, I never know which
of them I’m for loving best. At times I think
’tis this fair lady, then I’m for thinking ’tis yonder
creamy Devonionsis, or that drooping white
Niphetos, or Caroline Testout smiling away over
there. But for the most I’m always coming
back to General Jacqueminot. ’Tis the old-fashionedness
of him, and his sturdy ways, and,
more than all, the sweet scent of him. If you’re
down on your luck, and take a good sniff at him,
why, the world’s a different place that very minute.
There’s all the sunshine of the summer, and the
humming of the bees, and the laughter of children,
and your mother’s voice, and all the memories of
your boyhood in the scent, there is that. And
you’d laugh yourself, the while there’s a queer
tenderness is catching at your heart for happy
tears.”</p>

<p>“I know,” nodded David. (I have not insulted
your intelligence by giving him a former and
formal introduction.) “I know. There are scents
like that. They are alive. They are worth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>a million words, or a million pictures. I could
be taken blindfold across the world, and if I
were set down on the veldt I would know the
scent in an instant. It’s hot, pungent, aromatic.
I’d see the scrubby bushes, the scarlet everlastings,
the flame-coloured heaths, and the straggling blue
lobelia. I’d see the mountains, blue against the
sun, and golden facing it. I’d feel the great
spaces, and the vast distances. I’d&mdash;” he
broke off with a laugh. “There I am trying to
give you in words what only the scent of the place
can really give you.”</p>

<p>“Words are poor things,” said Father Maloney
smiling, “when you come to wanting to express
what lies closest to your heart. I’m thinking
’tis like the Tower of Babel over again, after a
fashion. We can talk fast enough when our
thoughts are down near the earth, but the moment
they get up a bit, for the most of us our tongue is
halting and stammering, and there’s confusion.
I’m thinking it’s as well, or we might get a bit
above ourselves with glibness of speech, and be
fancying ourselves embryo prophets and visionaries,
and getting others to fancy it along with us.”</p>

<p>David flicked an insect off a rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>“There’s not much need for speech if you happen
to be with the right person, is there?” said he
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Father Maloney’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>“There is not,” quoth he. “Or, at all events,
your stammering will stand you in good stead.”</p>

<p>And then Anastasia rang the tea-bell.</p>

<p>Father Maloney started almost guiltily. Time
had stolen a march on him, it would appear. He
looked uneasily towards the house.</p>

<p>“That’s your tea-bell,” said David calmly,
voicing the obvious.</p>

<p>“It is that,” said Father Maloney. “I&mdash;will
you be having a cup,” he blurted out.</p>

<p>For one instant, for just one brief instant,
David hesitated, then,</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he said.</p>

<p>“’Tis altogether bewitched I am,” groaned
Father Maloney inwardly, as he accompanied his
guest towards the house.</p>

<span class="smaller">A VITAL QUESTION</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">A whalebone</span> Anastasia brought a second cup
for “this gentleman.” She heard well enough the
trace of guilt in Father Maloney’s voice, knew also
well enough who the gentleman was, of that you
may be very sure. You cannot, believe me, pass
two days, or even one day, in Malford without
the majority of the population becoming fully and
miraculously acquainted with your whole previous
history and antecedents. I’ll not vouch for the
entire accuracy of the information; to do so
would be mere rashness on my part, but certain it
is that the information collected by Anastasia was
more than sufficient to account for her whalebone
rigidity of bearing, and also for an unpleasant
little sniff on receiving Father Maloney’s order.</p>

<p>If she imagined that this obvious disapproval
of manner would affect Father Maloney, she was
vastly mistaken, at all events as to the manner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>of effect produced. You might have imagined
that twelve years in his service might have gained
her some experience. But not a bit of it. Her
own preconceived notions of what should be were
infinitely too deeply engraven to be eradicated
by what was. If I desired to be trite, I might discourse
for a chapter and more on this common
state of affairs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Father Maloney’s sitting-room was a small,
shabby place. There was nothing artistic about
it; there was nothing even particularly comfortable,
with the exception of two large armchairs,
which, having been much sat in, had become
remarkably adapted to the human form. Anastasia
having had a field day therein that morning,
it smelt both clean and bare. It had that peculiar,
tidy, empty smell of a newly cleaned room.</p>

<p>After such a day, Father Maloney uttered
inward prayers for patience. Long experience
had shown him that it was useless to inform
her that a desk was specially constructed to hold
scattered papers; that chairs were an infinitely
preferable receptacle for books than the top shelf
of a lofty bookcase; that a tobacco jar was intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
to stand on the piano, rather than in a cupboard
behind a waste-paper basket, a coal-scuttle, a
broken chair, and a screen; that the bottom drawer
of a bureau, which opened only by sheer physical
force, was not the place he would ordinarily choose
for his pipes. Such information fell on ears as
deaf as the ears of the proverbial adder, despite the
wise charm of its utterance. Therefore, having
in view Anastasia’s other, and excellent, qualities,
Father Maloney merely prayed for patience, as I
have indicated.</p>

<p>David looked round the room. In a manner of
speaking, he weighed, judged and appraised the
mental atmosphere from that which he noted.</p>

<p>Firstly, he observed the shabbiness, which I
have mentioned; secondly, he smelt the almost
aggressive cleanliness, which I have also mentioned;
thirdly, he noted a curiously combined
homeliness and discomfort; fourthly, he took in
various details,&mdash;a <i>prie-dieu</i> in one corner, with a
cheap Crucifix above it; a large framed photogravure
of Pope Pius X over the mantelpiece; a
small, badly coloured statue of the Sacred Heart
on one wooden bracket, and an equally badly coloured
statue of Our Lady on another; gilt-framed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>oleographs of saints scattered about the walls, the
gilt poor and rubbed, the oleographs horribly crude;
a thumbed office-book lying on a crimson plush-covered
sofa, the broken corner of a lace-edged
card protruding from it.</p>

<p>It was all amazingly artificial, and yet&mdash;well, it
was real. There was the extraordinary paradox.
On one side the artificiality was utterly apparent;
on the other it stood for something, and that something
was neither artificial, imaginary, nor even
commonplacely real, but vividly, vitally real. It
was like recognizing a soul in a wax-work, or
finding life in a daguerreotype.</p>

<p>David sniffed the mental atmosphere, so to
speak, vainly endeavouring to arrive at an understanding
thereof, gave it up as a bad job, and then
suddenly received a flash of illumination.</p>

<p>“It’s because it’s all real to him,” he concluded.
But felt, nevertheless, that somehow the conclusion
did not absolutely reach the mark.</p>

<p>Arriving at his second cup of tea, David spoke.
The conversation so far had been more or less trivial.
Here, it would appear, was a weightier matter.</p>

<p>“I’ve been asked to dine at the Castle on
Thursday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“Yes?” From Father Maloney’s voice one might
have judged the information as not altogether
a surprise.</p>

<p>“I’ve accepted,” said David.</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Father Maloney again. He perceived
that there was something further to come.</p>

<p>David reddened slightly beneath his tan.</p>

<p>“The fact is,” he blurted out, “I’d forgotten
all about dress clothes. I know people do wear
the things. I haven’t got such a suit to my
name.”</p>

<p>Father Maloney cut a slice of cake.</p>

<p>“Sure, such things are not obligatory in the
country at all, they are not,” quoth he calmly.
“In the town now&mdash;but the country, ’tis quite
another matter.” He looked straight at David’s
anxious eyes.</p>

<p>“Sure?” demanded David.</p>

<p>“It’s dead certain I am,” returned Father
Maloney.</p>

<p>David fetched a big sigh.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully glad I mentioned it to you,” he
responded. “The matter was sitting on my chest
a bit.”</p>

<p>“Glory be to God!” laughed Father Maloney.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Half</span> an hour later Father Maloney was wending
his way towards Delancey Castle.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking she’ll not altogether understand,”
mused he ruefully, “but ’twas the child’s eyes
of him, ’twas just that. Though if he hasn’t a
will at the back of them, my name’s not Dan
Maloney.”</p>

<p>An hour later he was bearing a note in the
direction of the White Cottage. It was addressed
to John Mortimer, Esq. It contained a sentence
which may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>“Please will you both wear morning dress at
dinner on Thursday.”</p>

<p>Father Maloney tramped along the road looking
at the hedges and the trees. Finally he raised
his eyes to the sky.</p>

<p>“She’s a wonderful woman is Lady Mary!”
he ejaculated, “A wonderful woman!”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WONDERFUL WOMAN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">But</span> underneath the wonderfulness there was a
heartache. You can hardly expect it to have been
otherwise; and, for my part, I would not have had
it otherwise. She wouldn’t have been one quarter
the adorable old lady she was, if there hadn’t been
that heartache.</p>

<p>If, from some lofty and ascetic perch, she could
have calmly contemplated her approaching departure
from Delancey Castle with never a tremor, with
never a soul-stabbing, then, very assuredly, she
would have been one of a genus of human beings
that I would find it in vain to attempt to comprehend.
It is through the very humanity of the
saints that one feels their lovableness. They
felt intensely; they had their loves and their
hates, their likes and their dislikes, their joys and
their sorrows; they were living, sensitive, human
creatures, not masses of granite, nor insensible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>lumps of putty. And it wasn’t one atom because
they didn’t care for happiness and pleasure, and
possibly even for luxury, that they became saints,
but just because they did care, and caring gave all
these things as a free and generous gift to God.</p>

<p>Of course you know this every bit as well as I
do, but I like to remind myself of it every now and
then. And sometimes God may have given them
back their own actual gifts to Him, even while
they were still on earth,&mdash;gifts refined, transmuted
by some wonderful purifying process in His hands.
But most often it would seem that He gave them
another gift in exchange,&mdash;that wonderful gift,
Sorrow, of which only a saint can see the true
beauty. Yet always He gave them back in full
and overflowing measure one gift that must of
necessity have been offered with the other gifts,&mdash;the
gift of love towards Him.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to infer from this that Lady
Mary was a saint. That would be a matter on
which I naturally should not venture to express
an opinion. One leaves such decisions to God
and the Holy Fathers. But she was very assuredly
a wonderful woman, as Father Maloney had
remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>If her heart was old in years, it was young in
immortal youth. She revelled in the sunshine,
she revelled in happiness; I am not sure that she
didn’t bask in it. I fancy there would be little
real gratitude if we accepted these gifts timorously,
fearing lest their removal should follow quickly.
To my thinking, the truest gratitude, the fullest
trust, is to accept them with whole-hearted enjoyment,
to say a real “thank You” for the loan, when
the time comes that God asks us to give it back
again. Naturally our manners would be as disagreeable
as those of a badly brought-up child if we
clung to the gift lent us till it had to be taken
from us by force. The first hint is sufficient for
a nicely brought-up child. But never be grudging
or timorous of enjoyment during such time as the
happiness is lent.</p>

<p>Truly I believe this was Lady Mary’s attitude.
Now, of course, there was a big sense of loss, a
pretty heavy heartache, and even the tiniest
question, Why? At the first, I don’t think that
she had realized that the happiness had been
merely a loan. She had looked upon it as hers by
right. There’s the danger with prolonged loans.
You begin to forget that they aren’t actually yours.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>But, if she had forgotten, it was only for a moment;
and now, in spite of the heartache, her “thank
You” was genuinely spoken.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lady Mary was sitting by a window facing
towards the sea. It shone pearly iridescent, in
the evening light. The sky beyond reflected the
glory of the sunset; grey near the water, it merged
upwards into soft rose-colour, and thence to blue-green.
The earth was bathed in soft, glowing light.</p>

<p>Only the faintest whisper of air came through
the open window,&mdash;a faint, cool sigh of relief
after the heat of the day. Below, in the garden,
were golden splotches of colour&mdash;beds of great
African marigolds, a vivid contrast to the cool
green of the close-dipped grass. Through the
silence came the musical dripping of a fountain.</p>

<p>Overhead a door opened. She heard a child’s
voice, and then a little burst of laughter. Again
there was silence. And slowly the rose-colour
faded in the sky, till only a pale lavender-grey haze
covered land and water.</p>

<p>The gold of the marigolds became softly blurred;
the green of the grass lost its colour.</p>

<p>A little haunting melody came suddenly into her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>mind,&mdash;one she had often played in childhood. It
was a melody by Heller. There is a footnote at the
bottom of the page on which it is written, which
designates it “Twilight,” or “Le crépuscule.”
The latter word came into her mind at the moment.
It held greater significance to her than the English
word. It represented more clearly the onward
stealing of the grey shadows, the soft sweet
evening sadness, the slow passing of the day’s
glory.</p>

<p>And then, once more, overhead a door opened.
There was a pattering of footsteps along the
corridor, a child’s voice, clear, demanding:</p>

<p>“Granny, prayers!”</p>

<p>Lady Mary got up from her chair. If there was
something of the evening shadows in her eyes, I
fancy there was also the aftermath of the sunset’s
glory.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow I must tell Antony,” she said.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CACHE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">John</span> was walking over the moorland. He had
been walking for the last hour and more. It was
nearing five o’clock. He had made a great circle,
and was now somewhere near the place where he
had first had sight of a fair lady and her two
attendant knights.</p>

<p>At the moment there was no human being in
sight. He had the earth, it would appear, entirely
to himself. Only furze-chats and yellow-hammers
twittered in the gorse around him; little blue
butterflies and brown underwings flitted over
the heather. To the right it lay one great purple
sheet, broken only by the gorse bushes. Their
golden glory of April had long since passed away,
but yellow flowers still lingered among their prickly
shields. You know the old adage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When the gorse is out of bloom.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kissing is out of fashion.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>To the left lay a stretch of long brown grass,
dry and coarse. The wind, rustling softly through
it, whispered of summer secrets. It came blowing
softly, faintly, from the distant blue sea. Truly it
was a day for whole-hearted enjoyment, for content,
for reposefulness, for each thing and everything
that goes to sum up entire happiness.</p>

<p>But if you imagine John to be in this restful
mood, you are vastly mistaken. Three thoughts
repeated themselves with about equal recurrence
in his mind. The first was merely a name&mdash;Rosamund.</p>

<p>The birds twittered it, the wind whispered it,
the faint understirrings in the heather took it up
and repeated it with tantalizing insistence.</p>

<p>Rosamund, Rosamund, Rosamund.</p>

<p>A fair name truly; a poetical name. John, at
the moment, might have emulated Orlando, who
hung a very similar name on every tree. Only
here there were no trees at hand, merely gorse
bushes, and purple heather.</p>

<p>The second thought was a quotation. It ran
through his head again and again.</p>

<p>“Never the time, and the place, and the loved
one altogether.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“He knew what he was talking about,” sighed
John. “Unquestionably, at the moment, it would
seem the veritable time and place,&mdash;the sunniest
most desirable time, the sweetest-scented most
gorgeous place. But she isn’t here. And, if
she were, I’d bet anything the time and place
would seem all wrong. The time would jump to
about a million of years ahead, and as far the
place&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>To tell the truth he hadn’t much idea as to what
would happen to the place. His thoughts were
hardly what might be termed precisely coherent,
but perhaps you can arrive at some kind of a guess
at them.</p>

<p>The third thought was neither fair, nor poetical.
It was summed up in the one short, pithy phrase,</p>

<p>“Drat the man!”</p>

<p>By which token it will be seen that John had
not yet recovered from his Monday’s mood.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t intend to attempt any detailed
explanation as to why both John and Father
Maloney had found themselves in this curious
state of unwilling perturbation after one meeting
with David Delancey, but it is very certain that
the perturbation had not only arrived, but remained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
Of course you will say sagely that it was
the man’s personality, and equally of course you
will be right. But what was there in his personality
to cause this perturbation in two such entirely
dissimilar minds? There’s the question! And I,
for my part, can find no satisfactory verbal explanation
of it. It is one thing to have the
explanation in one’s mind, knowing the man; it is
quite another to set it forth coherently in words.
Therefore I will content myself with your sage
remark that it was his personality.</p>

<p>“Drat him!” said John again.</p>

<p>And then he stopped short, looking towards the
heather to his right</p>

<p>His attention had been attracted by a curious
little mound of stones. Now it is not in the least
unusual to see stones lying on a moorland among the
heather. But to John’s eye there <i>was</i> something unusual
about these stones. They had unquestionably
been placed there by human agency; they were not
the haphazard arrangement of mere chance.</p>

<p>John went across the heather towards them.
They were built up in a small rough circle; a
large flat stone formed a kind of roof or lid to
them. John bent towards the mound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>A sound, a very slight sound, made him raise
his head. There was no one in sight. He had the
earth, as I have told you, to himself. Only the
wind whispered among the heather and grass, and
rustled softly through the gorse bushes.</p>

<p>John went down on his knees and raised the
flat stone. Sheer idle curiosity prompted the
action. He hadn’t the faintest expectation of
seeing anything beneath. He peered within;
and then gave vent to a tiny chuckle of amazed
surprise. He put his hand within the circle of
stones, and drew forth three objects,&mdash;firstly, a
piece of green ribbon; secondly, a small, a very
small, thimble; and thirdly, a rosary of red beads.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” quoth he to himself, “if fairies have
been at work here, they are Catholic fairies, it
would seem.”</p>

<p>He fitted the thimble on the top of his little
finger, where it sat in an insecure and ludicrous
position.</p>

<p>“A <i>cache</i>,” said John, “but whose?”</p>

<p>He looked before him down the sloping moorland.
And now, far off, he descried a small
black speck. The black speck was a figure. It
was coming towards him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“There’s just the faintest conceivable chance,”
said John.</p>

<p>He removed the thimble from its ridiculous
position. He put it, the ribbon, and the rosary
once more within their hiding-place, replaced the
flat stone, and withdrew himself to a post of
vantage, couched behind a gorse bush. Therefrom
he awaited possible developments.</p>

<p>As the black speck drew nearer, it defined itself
as a girl child, some eleven years old or thereabouts.
A gypsy-looking elf she was. Coming
nearer still, he saw that she was dark-haired,
smutty-eyed. Her head was uncovered; she was
clad in a faded green frock; her brown legs were
bare, her feet cased in old shoes. She was walking
quickly; eagerness, expectation, were in her
bearing. To John’s mind the possibility already
resolved itself into something akin to certainty.
The next moment he saw that his surmise had
been correct.</p>

<p>She came straight across the heather to the small
circle of stones, and went down on her knees beside
it. The flat stone was pushed aside; the small
brown hand dived within the circle.</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>John heard the little gasp of pleasure.</p>

<p>She came to a sitting posture, the treasures
gathered on to her lap. John saw her face plainly.
The ribbon and thimble were examined with sheer
and palpable delight. The rosary was handled
gravely; there was the tiniest hint of question in
the handling. Then suddenly she lifted it to her
lips. The next moment she was on her knees
again, telling the beads devoutly.</p>

<p>“If,” quoth John to himself, “I am not much
mistaken, ’tis that young limb of mischief, Molly
Biddulph.”</p>

<p>And there she knelt in the sunshine, among the
heather, looking, for all the world, a young, rapt
devotee of prayer, the scarlet beads falling through
her small brown fingers. Her eyes were closed;
her lips moved rapidly. Here was matter for a
poet’s pen; a subject for an artist’s brush. The
soft wind stirred the dark hair on her forehead, the
sun kissed her bronzed cheeks. A butterfly flitted
to her shoulder, lighted a moment, circled round
her head, and flew away.</p>

<p>Coming to an end of her orisons, she made a
great Sign of the Cross, got to her feet, and sped
away down the hill, clutching her treasures tightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>John came from behind the gorse bush.</p>

<p>“Well!” said he aloud.</p>

<p>“It might be called a pretty little scene,” said
a voice behind him.</p>

<p>Turning, amazed, he met a pair of laughing
eyes, saw a white-robed figure, and two attendant
knights.</p>

<p>“You!” quoth John.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“We were afraid, so dreadfully afraid, lest you
should decamp with the treasures,” said she.
“I had the greatest difficulty in restraining these
two from rushing to the rescue.”</p>

<p>“I <i>thought</i> I heard a sound!” ejaculated
John.</p>

<p>“It was me,” said Michael. “I squeaked, but
Aunt Rosamund held my mouf.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said John, “<i>you</i> are the fairies?”</p>

<p>“It is our <i>cache</i>,” quoth Antony magnificently.</p>

<p>“So I am beginning to perceive,” responded
John. “But why, if I may ask without undue
curiosity, is Molly in the matter? I imagined it
was Molly. And, if all accounts be correct,
she would appear hardly a subject for especial
favours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>Rosamund’s eyes danced. John had a mental
image of sunlight suddenly sparkling on still
waters.</p>

<p>“It is just,” she explained, “that she appears, as
you say, hardly a subject for favours, that she
gets them.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” John was frankly a trifle bewildered
by the explanation.</p>

<p>“It was Tony’s idea,” smiled Rosamund.</p>

<p>She had seated herself on the heather, and John
had followed her example. The boys were some
paces ahead of them, examining the <i>cache</i>.</p>

<p>“Tony,” pursued Rosamund, “discovered
that pleasant anticipation is conducive to good
behaviour. He solemnly assured me of the fact
one day. Therefore we&mdash;or, at least, I&mdash;conceived
the idea of putting the theory to the test.”</p>

<p>“Therefore,” said John, “you established a
<i>cache</i> for Molly.”</p>

<p>“We established a <i>cache</i> for Molly,” echoed she.
“We lured her to it in the most innocent way
imaginable. Of course she hasn’t the remotest
notion as to who has established it. That would
be to spoil the joy of it. It is the hint of secret
magic about it that is half its delight. The contents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
are dependent on conduct, you understand.
At least a fortnight’s exemplary behaviour brings
the kind of reward you perceived today. Often
there may be merely a flower found. If the fairies
are dissatisfied, I have known them to put a
couple of snails within the <i>cache</i>.” Again her
eyes danced.</p>

<p>“Brown pools that have caught and held a
sunbeam,” thought John.</p>

<p>Aloud he said ruminatively, “I wonder what
becomes of the snails.”</p>

<p>Rosamund gave a little shiver.</p>

<p>“I fear me,” said she, “that once at least, they
were&mdash;squashed!”</p>

<p>“Hum!” quoth John. “I have an idea that if
I were seeking&mdash;say a rose, and found a snail instead,
that the snail might possibly be subjected
to a like fate.”</p>

<p>“But it wasn’t the poor snails’ fault,” she
objected.</p>

<p>“We have frequently,” said John sententiously,
“to suffer for the sins of others. If I might offer
a suggestion, I would point out that the fairies’
displeasure might be equally well marked by coal,
stones, or even a copybook maxim. How does
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>‘Be good and you’ll be happy,’ or ‘Gifts are the
reward of virtue,’ strike you?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Fairies,” she assured him, “never indulge in
moral reflections. They merely act.”</p>

<p>“‘Deeds, not words,’ being their motto,”
laughed John. “But coal, now!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she conceded, “I think coal might
answer our purpose.”</p>

<p>There was a little pause.</p>

<p>“To a mere casual observer,” remarked John
reflectively, “the young person in question might
have appeared an embryo saint. From which we
perceive the truth of the adage that appearances
are deceitful.”</p>

<p>“Not in every case,” she retorted. “How do
you know that she isn’t an embryo saint? Very
much in embryo, I’ll allow. Oh, but there’s
stuff in Molly. But do you suppose she’s understood
among the village folk? Not a bit of it!
It’s respectability they admire, wooden respectability.”</p>

<p>“Hum,” said John.</p>

<p>“And Molly isn’t wooden.”</p>

<p>“No,” acquiesced John fervently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>Rosamund laughed.</p>

<p>“And therefore,” she continued, “they see
downright sin in her&mdash;well, her unwooden escapades.
And they haven’t a notion, the faintest
notion of her possibilities.”</p>

<p>“As either sinner or saint,” suggested John.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s the stuff for either there,” she
agreed.</p>

<p>“I own,” said John somewhat irrelevantly,
“that there’s a certain attraction in sinners.”</p>

<p>“Of course there is,” she retorted, “if it’s
brilliant enough sinning. It’s the personality
that attracts, though the material has run off the
rails. Only people so often make the mistake of
contrasting brilliant sinning with commonplace
goodness. If you want your contrasts, you should
place commonplace goodness alongside commonplace
sinning&mdash;pettiness, meanness, drunkenness,
hateful little detractions, and all the rest of the
sordid category. And then put brilliant sinning
alongside the impetuous ardour of St. Peter, or
the mystic sweetness of St. John.”</p>

<p>“You speak sagely,” quoth John. “It is, I
fear, a matter of contrasts which one is extremely
apt to overlook.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>Again there fell a little silence. And the birds
twittered, and the sun shone, and the butterflies
flitted over the heather, and a thousand words
rose to John’s lips, only to remain unspoken,
because the time had somehow leaped to about a
million of years ahead. It was not the moment,
he knew it was not the moment, and yet&mdash;and
yet&mdash; Well, at any rate she was there beside him
on the heather. The faintest scent of perfume&mdash;violets,
perhaps? came to him from her garments.
For all his outward calm, for all his level, easy,
careless voice, his heart was in a tumult.</p>

<p>“You and Mr. Elmore are dining with us
tonight,” she reminded him on a sudden.</p>

<p>“I had not forgotten.” John’s voice was full
of assurance.</p>

<p>“You know,” quoth she tentatively, “that you
are to meet&mdash;Sir David Delancey.” There had
been the fraction of a pause before the name.</p>

<p>“I know,” said John, his eyes clouding.</p>

<p>“My grandmother felt it might ease the situation,”
she explained. There was a sudden little
note of confidence in the words. “A dinner <i>en
famille</i> might be, indeed must be, a trifle difficult.”</p>

<p>“I quite understand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>She pulled at a sprig of heather.</p>

<p>“Father Maloney has seen him,” she said
abruptly. “He&mdash;he seems favourably impressed.”</p>

<p>“I, too, have seen him,” owned John. It was
not altogether easy to make the statement.</p>

<p>“You!” She was frankly surprised.</p>

<p>He gave her a brief account of the meeting.</p>

<p>“And&mdash;and he was passable?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said John grudgingly, honesty forcing
the truth from him, “he is really quite a decent
fellow.”</p>

<p>She glanced up quickly, understanding his tone.</p>

<p>“You would rather,” said she, “dislike him quite
frankly.”</p>

<p>“You have stated the case,” said John.</p>

<p>“I quite understand,” she nodded.</p>

<p>And then Antony and Michael came towards
them from the <i>cache</i>. The two on the heather
bestirred themselves.</p>

<span class="smaller">DAVID DINES AT THE CASTLE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">When</span> John, with Corin in his wake, entered the
drawing-room of Delancey Castle that evening,
he glanced anxiously around. He had no real
cause for anxiety. He was a good ten minutes in
advance of the hour mentioned, having led a
protesting Corin up the hill at a fine pace.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell had seen them depart, her face
an amazed and horrified note of interrogation.</p>

<p>“You’re dining with her ladyship!” she had
gasped.</p>

<p>“We are,” John had assured her.</p>

<p>“You aren’t never going up to dine at the Castle
in them clothes!” she had ejaculated.</p>

<p>“We dine,” John had said smiling, “in these
very clothes that you now perceive upon us.”</p>

<p>“Land sakes!” Mrs. Trimwell had gasped. And
words failing her, either from horror, or lack of imagination,
she had mutely watched them depart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>They had started betimes; they had also, as I
have stated, walked at a fine pace; and now, somewhat
heated, they found themselves shaking hands
with Lady Mary, while the clock yet wanted some
ten minutes of seven-thirty.</p>

<p>But, so argued John, surveying the said clock,
half an hour, even an hour too soon, was infinitely
preferable to one minute too late. It was the first
moment of meeting that would set the keynote to
the whole evening. It was at that first psychological
moment that the easement of his presence was
necessary. Corin, he considered as quite beside
the mark, you perceive.</p>

<p>Father Maloney was already present. He was
seated in the window-seat with Antony and
Michael, who had been granted half an hour’s
furlough from bed.</p>

<p>And now came the moments of suspense,&mdash;an
anxious waiting. Corin and the two boys alone
were absolutely at their ease. Corin, having
engaged Rosamund in conversation, was expatiating
on his day’s work. John, his eyes on the clock,
his ear alert for the opening of a door, talked to
Lady Mary. It is fairly certain that her eyes and
her ears were likewise occupied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“I hear from the boys that you were present
at the <i>cache</i> this afternoon,” said she smiling.</p>

<p>John laughed.</p>

<p>“It was a fairy-tale scene,” quoth he. “I
wouldn’t have missed it for worlds. It isn’t often
an imaginative conception works so successfully.”</p>

<p>“In this instance,” she reminded him, “there
was the Celtic temperament to deal with. Nothing
is beyond the imagination of a Celt, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“No,” said John musingly. And then, “Not as
criticism, but merely as query, I wonder how far
it is justifiable to play upon it?”</p>

<p>“You mean that Molly’s imagination was played
upon?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I fancy,” said Lady Mary, “that the human
element comes into most of our material rewards.
It is the agency by which they are worked. In this
case the human agency merely hid itself beneath a
fantastic garb, thereby adding a subtle pleasure
to the reward. I don’t know whether Molly believes
in her heart of hearts that the fairies had
been at work, any more than I’ll vouch for Tony’s
and Michael’s belief in Santa Claus filling their
stockings. I fancy there are many things the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>pleasure of which is enhanced by their being
shrouded in the soft light of imagination, rather
than by their being dragged forth to the somewhat
garish light of fact. There’s no lack of truth in
keeping them shrouded. There is, after all, no
necessity to be merely blatant.”</p>

<p>“No,” laughed John.</p>

<p>“Most children,” went on Lady Mary, “have
a subtle power of imagination. If you were to
bring them to hard bed-rock fact, they’d own to
the imagination, though probably reluctantly.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said John, “a willow wand is not
a spear, neither is a broomstick a horse, nor a
twisted tree-trunk a dragon, and you know it.
But when you ride forth on the horse, armed with
the spear, to kill the dragon, you suffer some
terrible and indefinable loss when the actual facts
of the case are set before you in faultless English
by an all too-truthful aunt.”</p>

<p>“You see,” smiled Lady Mary.</p>

<p>“I see,” said John, “and I withdraw my query,
or, rather, you have answered it.”</p>

<p>There was a silence, and again they both waited.
They made no attempt to break the silence. It
could only have been broken now by some entirely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>futile remark, and neither John nor Lady Mary
was in the mood for such remarks.</p>

<p>John looked in the direction of Rosamund and
Corin. He saw that the former glanced towards
the door every now and again, and back from it to
the clock. The minutes seemed interminably slow
in their passing. And then, suddenly, footsteps
were heard in the hall without. John’s heart
leaped; Lady Mary’s face was pale; Rosamund
was smiling; Father Maloney looked up from
the little tin soldier he was examining.</p>

<p>The door opened and the butler appeared on
the threshold. He muttered something. Certainly
his speech was not his usual clear enunciation.
John, seeing his solemnly injured expression, felt
a sudden desire to laugh. Lady Mary certainly
smiled. And then David Delancey entered the
room.</p>

<p>Of course the actuality wasn’t half, or a quarter,
as bad as the anticipation. In two minutes the
introductions were over. John had shaken hands;
everyone had shaken hands; Antony, in a clear
treble, had informed the guest that it was on his
account alone that he and Michael had been
granted half an hour’s furlough from bed. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>announcement broke the ice, so to speak; if,
indeed, there had been any to break. Probably
there wasn’t any. There had been a sudden thaw
the moment the solemnly injured butler had
appeared upon the threshold.</p>

<p>And David himself was so utterly simple. To
his direct mind the invitation alone had conveyed
sufficient assurance of his welcome. Why on earth
should it have been issued else? There you have
your child all over. He may hesitate to intrude
for fear of a snub; but, once let an invitation be
given, snubbing does not enter into the category
at all. Such conventionalities as enforced politeness
do not enter his mind. Of course Lady Mary
was as pleased to welcome him as David was to
make her acquaintance. It was <i>sine qua non</i> to the
present situation.</p>

<p>I don’t say it hadn’t surprised him. He had
been extremely surprised. It wasn’t in the least
the way he saw himself acting had he been in
Lady Mary’s place. Nevertheless he saw entire
genuineness in her action.</p>

<span class="smaller">JOHN MAKES A DISCOVERY</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Yet</span>, in spite of what might be called a good
beginning, the dinner party was not a success.
John was certain it hadn’t been a success. He
reviewed it, walking home with Corin in the starlight;
he continued to review it sitting in an armchair
with a pipe, since he was in little mood for
sleep.</p>

<p>And yet, wherein precisely did its failure lie?</p>

<p>It did not lie with Lady Mary; nor with Rosamund;
nor with Father Maloney; nor, he was
certain, with himself. (Corin, as already mentioned,
he left outside the category.) They had
each and all of them been courteous, friendly,
charming. They had kept the ball of conversation
tossing lightly from one to the other; they
had given David his full share of the game.
Certainly the fault did not lie with any of the
four. He could not, also, have said precisely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>that there was any fault at all. Outwardly, at
least, there was none. Yet there had been a subtle
atmosphere, an indefinable hint of something
lacking.</p>

<p>They had discussed books&mdash;standard authors&mdash;with
which David was well acquainted. They had
mentioned classical composers, with whom he was
certainly less familiar. They had talked of flowers,
birds, animals, sunsets, storms, and ships, and
here he was in his element.</p>

<p>He had talked well. John had received a vivid
impression of a land hot beneath the noonday
sun, of wine-red sunsets, the atmosphere aglow
with palpitating colour, the on-stealing of the
darkly purple night, the stars big and luminous
looking down with ever-watchful eyes upon the
lonely veldt. He saw the vivid reds of the flame-coloured
heaths and everlasting flowers, the
brilliant blue of the lobelias, the waxen whiteness
of the arum lilies. He heard the countless voices
of the grasshoppers, the low booming note of the
frogs, the muffled beating of the buzzards’ wings.
And above all he felt the vast illimitable spaces,
the great loneliness of the veldt. David had talked
of Muizenberg, and the white sands stretching for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>forty miles towards the mountains,&mdash;mountains
gold and orange in the sunshine, blue in the evening
twilight, the green sea bordering the sands,
emerald set against pearl.</p>

<p>He had talked of Cape Town,&mdash;of the Malay
men with their great baskets of flowers, of Table
Mountain with its silver-leaved trees, with the
rolling cloth of white cloud covering it. But here
he touched civilization; his speech was less fluent
than when he held them in the vast solemnity
of the lonely veldt.</p>

<p>And here John made a discovery. He perceived
all at once, not merely the loneliness of the veldt,
but the lonely spirit of the man who had dwelt on
it. It was that which had caused the subtle
incongruity in the atmosphere. He no more belonged
to his surroundings than did a hermit to
a London Club; and, so thought John, carrying his
discovery further, he&mdash;David&mdash;was, in a measure,
aware of that fact himself. He had been a fish out
of water, and however kindly, however charmingly,
landsmen may treat it, a fish on land is certainly in
an element in which it cannot by any possibility
be at ease. It is true that this particular fish had
entered the element of its own free will; but, so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>surmised John, it is equally true that he was not at
home in it. And yet, so John perceived with a fine
subtlety of perception, it was not the material
surroundings alone which were at the root of the
mischief. It lay deeper; it was in the mental
atmosphere that the uneasiness lay.</p>

<p>Now, he also perceived, or thought he perceived,
that while David was aware of the incongruity of
the situation, he had not fully recognized it to lie,
as John saw it to lie, in this same mental atmosphere.
This fact in itself increased the man’s
loneliness. He was not only isolated in mind from
those with whom he found himself, but he was
isolated from himself, because he did not understand
himself. It is the most bewildering kind of
loneliness. It is almost useless to attempt to describe
it in terms of speech. There are no precise
words for it. I, at least, can find none, and John
could not, though it is certain that he recognized
it in a measure.</p>

<p>And then by one of those sudden flashes of
inspiration which come to all men at times, or
which come, at all events, to those given to a
certain quality of mental analysis, John saw that
the more material drama, of which he was at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>present an audience, sank into insignificance before
the mental drama he had perceived. The man had
come, so he believed, into his material birthright,
but, regarding his mental birthright, he was
utterly ignorant. How, in what fashion would
he find it? if, indeed, he ever found it at all.</p>

<p>I do not say that John said all this to himself in
words, even in the somewhat clumsy manner in
which I have tried to express it. He perceived it
vaguely that night. The actual articulation of his
thoughts did not, I fancy, come till later.</p>

<span class="smaller">A FUNNY WORLD</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">“It’s</span> never a bit of good losing your temper,”
remarked Mrs. Trimwell sagely. “You can say
much more telling things if you don’t.”</p>

<p>She was clearing the luncheon table. John,
from the depths of an armchair, made a sound
slightly indicative of doubt.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Trimwell firmly, in reply to
the sound, “you can. Losing your temper you
never know what you are going to say, and as like
as not you’ll say something as’ll hit back on yourself,
and you be sorry you said later. Keeping it
you can have an eye to your neighbour’s weaknesses,
and pull them out to show, so to speak.”</p>

<p>John seemed to recognize some truth in this
statement.</p>

<p>“Whose weaknesses,” he demanded, “have
you been exposing?”</p>

<p>“He’s a captious man, is Vicar,” said Mrs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>Trimwell, and John perceived that her remark was
not irrelevant. “He’s never been what you’d call
pleased like in his mind that the biggest house to
the place is a papist house, and yet now when
they’re leaving he’s for railing against the new
occupant that is to be, and him no papist at all,
they say.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said John. He had fancied, be it stated,
that Mrs. Trimwell herself was not what might
have been termed cordial towards the interloper.</p>

<p>“I don’t say I’m wanting him at the Castle
myself,” pursued Mrs. Trimwell, in reply, it
would seem, to John’s unspoken thought, “but
Lor’ bless you, ’tisn’t exactly his fault if he is the
rightful heir, and it’s little more’n a child he is
for all he’s a man grown. He come in here yesterday
when I was stoning raisins for a cake. I don’t
say at first I was pleased for to see him. But,
‘Mrs. Trimwell,’ says he, ‘I want to thank you for
seeing to my foot. It’s a real doctor you are, for
I’d never but a limp the next day.’ And he sat
down, and watched me stoning of them raisins,
eating one now and again for all the world like a
great boy. And his eyes&mdash;have you seen his eyes,
sir? You couldn’t no more say a harsh word to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>him than you could to my baby. He stayed
chatting an hour and more, and I declare I thought
’twas only ten minutes.”</p>

<p>John laughed,&mdash;a curious little laugh.</p>

<p>“Then this morning,” went on Mrs. Trimwell,
“Vicar come in. He’d seen him yesterday afternoon
at the front door. Wanted to know what
he’d come for. As if a visitor can’t come to the
house without me answering a penny catechism
from Vicar. I up and as good as told him that.
And he began talking about loyalty to the family
at the Castle, and it’s never a word of loyalty he’s
had for them, and I can tell you. We got to words
a bit, and Vicar’s temper isn’t never sweetened
with the best sugar, but I kept mine. I called to
mind a thing or two as he’d said of the family,
and I let fall a hint now and again that I hadn’t
forgotten it neither. It’s wonderful the way it riles
a person if you’ve a good memory and let them
know it.”</p>

<p>John grinned.</p>

<p>“I’ll not be repeating all he said,” pursued Mrs.
Trimwell with dignity, “but I will say there were
some things I didn’t expect to hear a parson say.
But they’ll come back to himself. You can’t ever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>be real spiteful but they does. Did I ever tell you
about Mrs. Ashby and Lydia Ponsland?”</p>

<p>John intimated that she had not</p>

<p>“Them two always had their knife into me,
seeing that I gave them short shrift when they
come here with gossiping lies of my husband drinking
at the Blue Dragon over to Whortley. Lord
love you, sir, he’s never touched a drop more’n
was good for him since the day we married. I’ll
not swear to before that, seeing as young men will
be young men all the world over. Anyhow I
wasn’t going to listen to no lies from Mrs. Ashby
and Lydia Ponsland, and told them they was liars
to their face, which wasn’t perhaps the pleasantest
hearing for them, though the truth. My words
stuck, I’m thinking, and turned a trifle sour, and
they planned a bit of revenge. ’Twas the silliest
thing they did, though cruel at that, and you’d
never believe folks could have been that childish,
if I didn’t tell you ’twas the gospel truth. ’Twas
Christmas Eve, and I was over to Whortley for a
bit of shopping. My husband was at home with
the children, when five o’clock or thereabouts
there come a ring at the front door. Robert he
goes to see what ’tis. There’s a man there, and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>cart outside. ‘’Tis the coffin for your wife,’ says
he. Robert, he fails all of a tremble, and never
thinking, like a man, I couldn’t ha’ ordered my
coffin anyhows if I’d been dead. He don’t understand
it, and stays arguefying, and mortal frightened.
In the middle of their speechifying I comes
home, and I tell you it took me ten minutes and
more to make him believe I hadn’t no call for a
coffin yet awhile. ’Twas them two as had ordered
it, as I knew well enough, though couldn’t never
bring it clear home to them. But they was paid
for their evilness. Mrs. Ashby, she’s lost her
money, and is in a two shilling attic at Whortley
this very day, and Lydia’s down with rheumatic
fever what the doctor says she’ll not be getting
over this side of next Christmas. When God pays
He don’t pay in halfpence.”</p>

<p>The vigour with which Mrs. Trimwell brushed
the crumbs from the cloth served to emphasize
her statement.</p>

<p>“It was,” said John, “an astonishingly idiotic
thing for them to do.”</p>

<p>“Idiotic!” ejaculated Mrs. Trimwell, “I should
think it was idiotic. But there, they’d lost their
tempers and kept them lost for weeks; and if you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>mislay your temper like that it turns that sour
you’d be surprised. I’m for thinking Vicar hasn’t
found his yet, nor will be finding it for a bit. But
as I says to him, if a man finds his chance like this
one has, you can’t be surprised if he takes it. If
he don’t he’s a fool, and no more and no less. If
you get a chance, take it, says I, if you don’t
it goes off in a huff to somebody else.”</p>

<p>“Then,” remarked John ruminatively, “it
would be your advice that a chance should be taken
at all hazards, even at the expense of someone
else?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell looked dubious. It would appear
that this aspect of affairs had not previously struck
her.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” quoth she reflective, “I’ll own you
have me there. I couldn’t give you no clear
answer to that. It seems to me that the world’s
all a bit of shoving and pushing, and slipping
through gaps to the front when you see them.
And if you don’t do the slipping, someone else will.
I reckon it’s right enough if you’re not pushing
your own folk and friends aside. When it comes
to them, well, matters do get a bit awkward, I’ll
allow. What do you think, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>John shook his head.</p>

<p>“Frankly, Mrs. Trimwell, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Well, to tell you the honest truth, sir, no more
don’t I. It’s one thing to talk o’ the common-sense
point of view, but when you come straight
up to it, well, you sometimes wonders if it isn’t a
bit more edgey and cornery than you cares about.
’Tis a funny world.”</p>

<p>“It is,” said John fervently.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE OLD OAK</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Oh</span>, it was a funny world, fast enough, John knew
that. He’d known it in fits and starts all his life,
but somehow the last ten days had emphasized
the fact more fully.</p>

<p>Ten days! To John it seemed a lifetime since
he, in company with Corin, had stepped upon
Whortley platform, had taken his seat in the
rickety bus that had conveyed him at its own
shaky pace to the White Cottage. A lifetime!
And yet reason, that firm indicator of common-sense,
emphasized to the contrary. Anyhow, a
lifetime or ten days, the time had been long enough
for him to know his mind. He had known it for
weeks past. But for her? There was the question.
And it was one which common-sense, modesty, and
every other thought but his own wish, answered
firmly in the negative. He had seen her precisely
seven times, and two out of the number obviously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>went for nothing, seeing that the first time she had
been totally unaware of his presence, and the third
time, if she had seen him, it would have been
merely as one of a small congregation of worshippers,
his individuality entirely unnoticed.</p>

<p>Therefore, argued John, if what he so ardently
desired was, by any possible manner of means,
to be brought about by an increased number of
meetings, the sooner he set about increasing them
the better. Obviously the proper, the correct
thing to do, after lunching at a house, was to pay
a respectful call upon one’s hostess. He had no
need to consult an etiquette book to remind himself
of that fact.</p>

<p>True, he had lunched on Thursday, and this was
only Saturday, therefore the call might be considered
somewhat precipitate. But, argued John,
endeavouring to find some plausible excuse for the
precipitancy of the call, with the practical certainty
in view of meeting the family in the cloisters
after Mass the following day, the most desirable
course, the only correct and proper course, was to
call that very afternoon.</p>

<p>No sooner thought than decided on. John left
the White Cottage, betaking himself in the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
of the church, from which he intended to
drag a possibly reluctant Corin, and insist on his
mounting the hill in his company.</p>

<p>But his intentions and his insistence came to
nought.</p>

<p>A dusty, untidy, and wholly absorbed Corin
utterly refused to accompany him. Objection
number one, it was too soon to pay a call; objection
number two, it was Saturday afternoon, the
one afternoon in the week on which he enjoyed
solitude; objection number three, would John
kindly look at the discovery he had just made, and
then see if he&mdash;Corin&mdash;was likely to leave it for the
purpose of paying a merely conventional visit.</p>

<p>John looked. Corin was, at the moment, on
<i>terra firma</i>, be it stated.</p>

<p>On either side of where the altar would have
stood, had there been one, and some five feet or
so from the ground, the wall was partially uncovered.
A border in brilliant blue, red, black, and
yellow was disclosed,&mdash;a bold, simple pattern.
Below it, in the upper loops of a painted curtain,
were animals,&mdash;dragons, twisted of tail, forked of
tongue; a leveret, a deer, and a fox, each of these
last courant, to use the parlance of heraldry. For
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>the most part the animals were washed in boldly
in red; two of the dragons were a gorgeous yellow.</p>

<p>“I am certain,” said Corin enthusiastically,
“that they are after Geraldius Cambrensis. It’s
the best find of the lot. I’m not coming with you.
Nothing, no power on earth, can drag me from this
till dark. If you must go today, make my excuses.”</p>

<p>Therefore John departed.</p>

<p>The excuse was valid. It also gave a <i>raison
d’être</i> for his somewhat precipitate call. Miss
Delancey was interested in the discoveries in the
church. It would be merely friendly to let her
know of this new discovery as soon as possible.
Therefore, I say, John departed. Of course he
grumbled a moment or so before departing.
Equally of course the grumbling was of a merely
perfunctory nature.</p>

<p>And then he turned into the sunshine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His heart beat high as he walked up the hill. Of
course he was doing the right and obvious thing.
It would be absurd to wait till next week to pay
the visit. The day after tomorrow! How could
such a delay be contemplated? It would have
been impossible, unthinkable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>The eighth meeting! And surely there must
follow the ninth and the tenth, and heaven alone
knew how many more. And which, <i>which</i>, <span class="allsmcap">WHICH</span>
would be The Meeting? Of course it was absolutely
absurd to surmise on this point. It was impossible
to fix the moment beforehand. To come, as John
would have it to come, it must be almost inspirational,
heaven-sent. It couldn’t be arranged,
planned. It couldn’t be calculated over, preconceived.
But&mdash;and here John’s spirits went
down to zero with a sudden run&mdash;would it ever
come? Wasn’t he a presumptuous ass even to
dream of such a moment as possible? or&mdash;granting
the moment&mdash;to dream of its fruition? Wouldn’t
it be nipped in the bud instantly? frozen to a mere
shrivelled atom of a miserable moment? John
shivered at the thought. Then consolation took
him kindly by the hand. At all events here was
the eighth meeting, with the moment not yet
even in bud. Who could tell as to that budding?</p>

<p>And so he turned into the avenue.</p>

<p>He passed under the oaks and copper beeches,
the roadway now dappled with gold among
shadows, as the sunlight penetrated the branches
overhead. To the right, in the distance, were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>undulating stretches of moorland. He fancied he
could descry the silver-stemmed birch he had seen
on his first morning’s walk. Before him he had a
view of smooth green lawns, of brilliant flowerbeds,
backgrounded by the old grey Castle itself.
To the left the parkland sloped gently upwards to
a wood of beeches,&mdash;a serene, cool, silent place, a
veritable haunt of dryads.</p>

<p>Between the avenue and the wood was a great
oak tree, stretching wide branches above the
rough grass. Rumour had it that here was the
scene of that old-time tragedy. Though unknowing
of this rumour, John yet felt something almost
sinister about the twisted, gnarled branches, and
massive trunk of the great tree. There was a hint
of secrecy about it, the dumb knowledge of some
tragedy. Almost involuntarily he turned across
the grass towards it.</p>

<p>There was no question as to its great age. For
generations it must have stood there, weathering
storm and sunshine. Some seven feet or so from
the ground there was a hole in the trunk, large
enough to admit of the passage of a man’s head.
Scanning the hole, John noticed a rusty nail at
one side. He wondered, idly enough, why it had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>been placed there. From the hole, he glanced up at
the branches. Truly there was something almost
sinister in the great limbs. They were distorted,
twisted, as if in agony. Again he had the unreasoning
sensation of secrecy. It was an extraordinary
sensation, an absurd sensation.</p>

<p>He could fancy the spirit of the tree striving to
find expression in speech. There was a curious
feeling that somewhere, just beyond, in the spirit
world, perhaps, there was the key to some riddle.
It was an almost impalpable feeling; he barely
realized it; only somewhere, in his deepest inner
consciousness, it stirred slightly.</p>

<p>Below the tree was a small mound. Rumour
also had it that here Gelert, the wolf-hound, faithful
as his ancient namesake, was buried. Again,
John had had no hint of this rumour. But he
looked at the mound with curiosity. Then, suddenly,
he threw off the slight oppression that was
upon him, retraced his steps to the avenue.</p>

<p>Arrived at the big door, John pulled the bell, a
twisted iron thing whose voice sounded faintly in
some remote region. The door was opened, and
John saw into the hall, dark and shadowed. He
had a glimpse of bowls of roses, of a big straw hat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>lying on a table, green chiffon around the crown.
A pair of long crinkled gloves lay near it. So, for
an instant, John stood, his foot ready to cross the
threshold.</p>

<p>“Her ladyship is not at home.” The butler’s
bland voice fell like a douche of cold water on
John’s heart.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t know whether John’s face fell
in proportion to his heart, and the butler, more
human than the majority of butlers, saw the
falling, or whether his next statement came in
the mere ordinary routine of matters. Anyhow,</p>

<p>“But Miss Delancey is at home, and her ladyship
will return shortly,” followed closely on the
former speech.</p>

<p>John’s heart leaped to at least ten degrees above
the point from which it had fallen. The speech
had not even come as a query regarding his desire
to enter, it had come as simple statement of fact.</p>

<p>John stepped across the threshold.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE TERRACE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">She</span> came to him in the hall.</p>

<p>Underneath her cordial ease of manner was the
tiniest hint of shyness, a sort of half-forgotten
breath of extreme youngness, I might almost say
of childishness. Yet, very assuredly, there was
nothing <i>gauche</i> about the reception. The hint
merely served to emphasize her youth. If John
thought about her age at all, he probably placed
her at about twenty-two or thereabouts, which,
I take it, was pretty near the mark. But I don’t
fancy the thought entered his mind. It was
enough for him that there she was, sitting opposite
to him in the dusky hall. A ray of sunlight,
falling through an open window, caught the
burnished copper of her hair, turning it to vivid
flame. It looked a thing alive and palpitating,
a burning aureole around her face.</p>

<p>And now that the eighth meeting was accomplished,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
John found himself suddenly tongue-tied,
at a loss for any of those suitable little phrases
fitting to the occasion. Nothing is so infectious
as embarrassment, however slight, more particularly
if there be any degree of sympathy between
the two. Certainly it proved infectious in this
case. Words halted, phrases came disjointedly,
disconnectedly.</p>

<p>John cursed himself inwardly for a fool, a procedure
which, you may rightly guess, did not
vastly aid matters. And then, suddenly, Rosamund
got up from her chair.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come and see the garden,” she
suggested.</p>

<p>It was an inspiration. John followed her with
alacrity.</p>

<p>They came out on to a wide terrace. A stone
balustrade ran its full length, a balustrade covered
with climbing roses,&mdash;crimson, pink, white, yellow,
and a pale purple-lavender. A queer rose this
last, reminding one of the print gowns worn by
one’s grandmothers. Beyond the balustrade was
a sunk lawn, and beyond that again the parkland,
while further still was the shimmering blue
of the distant sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“How you must love it!”</p>

<p>The words escaped almost involuntarily from
John’s lips. The next moment he would have
recalled them. To remind her of the beauty of
what she was about to lose, must surely be to
emphasize the sense of that loss.</p>

<p>“Love it!” She turned towards him with a
little laugh. “It&mdash;it just belongs.”</p>

<p>John was silent. Rosamund leaned upon the
balustrade, half-sitting, half-standing.</p>

<p>“You needn’t mind saying what is in your
thoughts,” said she. And there was a little
whimsical smile in her eyes. “Of course you
can’t help thinking about the fact that we are
going to lose it all, any more than I can help
thinking about it. It makes freedom of speech
just a trifle difficult, if all the time you are feeling
it is a subject to be carefully avoided. Granny
and I speak of it quite naturally now.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to tell you how sorry I am,” said
John.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said simply.</p>

<p>There was a little pause. She gazed out towards
the sea. To the right, a headland jutted out into
its blueness. Sea-gulls circled in the quiet air,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>tiny specks in the distance. Boats, white and
red sailed, made lazy way with the tide.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned impulsively towards him.</p>

<p>“I fancy,” said she, “that I’m going to tell you
something.”</p>

<p>“Do!” said he, his eyes upon her.</p>

<p>“You’ll laugh.”</p>

<p>“Not a smile even.”</p>

<p>“Hmm!” she debated. “An over-dose of seriousness
<i>might</i> be even worse to face than laughter.”</p>

<p>“This is not fair,” protested John. “I can’t
measure a smile to the hundredth part of an
inch. I can, at least, promise not to mock at
you. Won’t that do?”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“Yes; I believe it will. Well, it’s this.” Her
voice dropped to seriousness. “I have a quite
unreasoning feeling that we shan’t leave here
after all. I can’t explain the feeling, and I
am fully aware of the almost absurdity of it. I
haven’t spoken of it to any one else. I can’t tell
my grandmother, or Father Maloney. It might
raise a faint hope which reason tells me will be
doomed to disappointment. And yet&mdash;well, it
seems almost that if one could only stretch out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>one’s hand a little way, through a kind of fog,
one would find the key to the whole riddle. It
must sound absurd to you, of course.”</p>

<p>John’s mind swung instantly to his own sensation
of less than twenty minutes ago.</p>

<p>“No,” he said quietly. “It doesn’t sound at
all absurd.”</p>

<p>She looked at him quickly.</p>

<p>“You speak almost as if you thought&mdash;” She
broke off. After all it was an absurd imagination.</p>

<p>“I have thought the same,” said John smiling.</p>

<p>“You!” She was amazed.</p>

<p>“Yes; as I came across the park just now.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>Again there was a little silence.</p>

<p>“I wonder&mdash;” she said musingly. “Do you
think there’s the faintest possible chance?”</p>

<p>“There’s always the faintest possible chance,”
John assured her. “Oh, I’ll grant it’s the faintest
possible, and heaven alone knows where it will
spring from. But it’s there, I know it’s there.
And we’ve both felt it.”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’ve felt it too. It adds a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>bit more hope, even while I’m almost laughing at
myself. Only&mdash;what is it we’ve both felt?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said John. “I don’t know
an atom. I think I get nearest the mark when I
say that it seems as if, somewhere, there’s a dumb
voice striving for expression. At least that is the
only way I can describe the sensation to myself.”</p>

<p>“And all the time,” she added, “there’s a
feeling of quietness in the atmosphere, the quietness
that precedes something very important
happening.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said John.</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s tantalizing,” she sighed, “the inward
knowledge of that, and yet the knowledge of
one’s own impotence.”</p>

<p>Her brow was wrinkled in a little frown, half
of annoyance, half of something like regretful
amusement. It was an adorable little frown,
and John longed, ardently longed, to smooth it
away. His heart beat and thumped, the while
it cried warningly that the time was not yet.
And from somewhere near at hand came the
liquid note of a pigeon.</p>

<p>“Go slow slowly, go slow slowly,” it seemed
to remind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we’re impotent enough,” assented
John, and a trifle gloomily.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it all melodramatic?” she laughed.</p>

<p>“Horribly,” agreed John.</p>

<p>“It’s an extraordinary conglomeration,” she
pursued. “Setting, old-world; drama, early Victorian;
period, twentieth century. Do you suppose
that any one who didn’t <i>know</i> about it,
would believe it?”</p>

<p>“Not an atom,” John assured her promptly.
“If any one, I for instance, were to write a novel
dealing with it, I’ll be bound I’d be considered
to have strained the long arm of coincidence to
breaking point. That’s the queer thing about
truth. It’s always a thousand times, a million
times, queerer than fiction.”</p>

<p>“It’s from precisely that&mdash;the very queerness
of it,&mdash;that I can derive some small modicum of
consolation,” she assured him gravely. “I feel,
on occasions, that I am not myself at all, but
merely a heroine in a book. Only, if I were,
I might be tolerably certain of a happy-ever-after
ending. I might say indisputably certain,
considering the style of the plot. Here it is
nothing but a toss-up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no.” John shook his head. “I wouldn’t
give mere chance quite such a free hand.”</p>

<p>“You mean that there’s a real plan behind it
all?” she demanded point blank.</p>

<p>“Oh, well!” said John. There was a slightly
quizzical smile in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Of course I know there is truly,” responded
she, smiling in her turn. “But&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But me no buts,” retorted John. “Chance
isn’t a free agent, and you know it; though I’ll
allow he has an extraordinary appearance of
acting on his own account now and again. But
that’s merely his guise. If he didn’t appear clad
in that fashion, we’d misname him; and I’ve an
idea he’s curiously tenacious of his personality.
People, you know,” continued John slyly, “are
apt to believe in his omnipotence.”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“I’ve believed in him myself before now,”
owned John, having a sudden memory of a black
and white goat. “Only subsequent reflection
invariably shows one that he isn’t acting on his
own account, as he would have us believe.”</p>

<p>“I fancy you’re right,” said she reflectively.
“If one really considers the seemingly haphazard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
happenings, one does see that there is
always a connecting link backwards and forwards.
Nothing&mdash;no happening&mdash;is entirely isolated.”</p>

<p>“It is not,” said John. “Only sometimes
the connecting link is so fine as to be almost
imperceptible.”</p>

<p>John had in mind a tiny faint link, so faint
that it was only in the light of subsequent events
that it had become visible. If, on a certain
March afternoon, he had not yielded to a sudden
inspiration to enter the Brompton Oratory,
would he now have been standing in this garden?
Was not that the tiny, almost imperceptible link
with all the events of the last ten days? Oh, he
had reason enough for his assured statement, he
had proved it to the hilt.</p>

<p>He wanted, he badly wanted, to tell her, to
speak of that tiny connecting link. But reason
again assuring him that to do so would be to drag
the moment too abruptly forward, he thrust
the desire aside. And then, from the distance,
came the sound of a silver gong.</p>

<p>Rosamund got up from the balustrade.</p>

<p>“Tea,” said she. “Granny must have returned.”</p>

<span class="smaller">AN UNEXPECTED LETTER</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">John</span> sat down to breakfast at about nine o’clock,
or thereabouts, the following Wednesday morning.
It was the Feast of Our Lady’s Assumption; he
had been to Mass at Delancey Chapel.</p>

<p>A letter was lying in his place. He took it up,
and opened it. Here are its contents.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear John</span>,&mdash;Unexpected business has brought
me over to London. It seems a thousand pities
to go back to Ireland without seeing you. Could
you get rooms for me at your sequestered spot
for ten days or so? Send me an early wire if
possible, and I’ll come down by the train arriving
tomorrow evening.</p>

<p class="right">“Your affectionate sister,</p>

<p class="right2">“<span class="smcap">Elizabeth Darcy</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Now, it is very certain that, from the time of our
Mother Eve, women have played an important part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>in the affairs of mankind, either for good or ill. But
it is equally certain that John had not the faintest
conception of the part Elizabeth would play in the
life of at least one person by this her proposed visit.</p>

<p>“Elizabeth suggests coming down for a few
days,” said John tentatively, and helping himself
to bacon.</p>

<p>“Elizabeth?” echoed Corin, gazing enquiringly
at John.</p>

<p>“My sister, Mrs. Darcy. I forgot you didn’t
know her.”</p>

<p>“By all means advocate her coming,” quoth
Corin. “I shall be delighted to make her acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“I wonder&mdash;” began John, and stopped.</p>

<p>“Well?” queried Corin.</p>

<p>“I wonder whether Mrs. Trimwell has another
room. Elizabeth suggests that I should take
rooms for her. She wants an early reply.”</p>

<p>“Then my suggestion,” remarked Corin calmly,
“is that you ask Mrs. Trimwell. On the whole
it would be simpler and more practical than
merely wondering.”</p>

<p>“Brilliant man!” responded John genially.
And he rang the bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell, it appeared, had not. She was
profuse in her apologies for the lack of accommodation.
You would have imagined that she was
entirely to blame for the fact that the White
Cottage possessed merely three bedrooms and
a cupboard, so to speak. Tilda and Benny&mdash;aged
four&mdash;slept in the cupboard.</p>

<p>“But there’s the Green Man what isn’t seven
minutes’ walk from here, and though I’ll not
vouch for the cooking myself, a bit of bacon and
a cup of coffee for breakfast is what any idiot
might rise to, it being pleasanter for the lady not
to be afoot too early, and the beds I believe is
clean, while for other meals she’ll natural take
them along of you.”</p>

<p>Of course Chance&mdash;so-called&mdash;had a hand in
the arrangement. If Elizabeth had both slept
and breakfasted at the White Cottage, I’ll vouch
for it that matters would not have happened precisely
as they did; indeed, they would probably
have been totally different.</p>

<p>John finished his breakfast, and then took a
telegram to the post-office.</p>

<p>He was genuinely, undeniably pleased that
Elizabeth was coming. He had a sensation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>something like exultation in the thought. She
was so extraordinarily reliable. Never under
any circumstances did Elizabeth “let you down,”
to use a slang phrase. There was never the smallest
occasion to remind Elizabeth that the intimate
remarks you made to her were confidences.
It was a foregone conclusion in her eyes. She
would no more dream of repeating them than she
would dream of tampering with another person’s
letters. Also, so reflected John, she never reminded
you that you had made them, unless it
was entirely obvious that you desired to be so
reminded. She never glossed over any difficulty,
but faced it squarely with you. The only people
who were ever disappointed in Elizabeth were
those who looked for a maudlin sympathy from
her, who desired her to fight their battles, when
she was fully aware that they alone could fight
them. Yet Elizabeth was entirely feminine,
from the top of her glossy brown hair, to the tip
of her dainty shoes. John, perhaps more than
any one else in the world, understood and appreciated
both her strength and her femininity. It
was therefore with a feeling of intense satisfaction
that he dispatched his telegram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“Things move when Elizabeth’s around,” reflected
John.</p>

<p>And then he walked on to the Green Man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>John, on the platform of Whortley station,
surveyed the people there collected with idle
interest.</p>

<p>It was market day in Whortley. Stout market
women, clutching empty, or partially empty,
baskets, sat on benches, their feet squarely planted
on the ground. Leather-gaitered men, whose
clothes gave forth a powerful aroma of horses
and cattle, strolled up and down, and talked in
groups. Children, hot and tired, and consequently
slightly irritable, bickered with each other, or
poked sticks at bewildered and exhausted hens
in crates. Somewhere in the back regions of the
station a couple of refractory oxen were being
driven into trucks. An atmosphere of almost aggressive
patience pervaded the much-tried porters.</p>

<p>“’Eat may be mighty good for the ’arvest,”
remarked one motherly looking woman, wiping
her face with a large white handkerchief, “but
I do say as ’ow it’s a bit trying to the spirit, and
likewise the body.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>“It’s the tempers of most people it gets at,”
replied her neighbour succinctly.</p>

<p>To which remark John responded with an
inward and fervent acquiescence. There was no
denying the heat; there was no denying the sultriness
of the dusty platform.</p>

<p>John strolled down to its further end.</p>

<p>Behind the town the sky was crimsoning to
sunset. The roofs of the dingy houses were
being painted red-gold in its light. The smoke
from a factory hung like a veil in the still air,
lending mystery to the atmosphere. The buildings
lay in a web of colour,&mdash;blue, grey, purple,
and gold. A cynic might have likened the sunset
glory to the glamour with which some foolish
people endow a merely sordid existence. In a
measure, too, his simile might have been justifiable;
but, whereas he would have scoffed, John,
with something of the same simile in mind,
thanked God for the gift of imagination.</p>

<p>And then, far to the right, he caught a glimpse
of white smoke above a dark serpent of an oncoming
train.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX<br />
<span class="smaller">ELIZABETH ARRIVES ON THE SCENE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">“Ruralizing,</span>” quoth Elizabeth, “agrees with
you.”</p>

<p>They were driving in a vehicle politely termed
a Victoria. It was not unlike a good-sized bath-chair.
It was driven by a one-armed boy. Seeing
the driver, Elizabeth had had a moment’s
qualm of heart. Then she had seen the horse.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a pleasant enough spot,” responded
John, “and&mdash;and restful.” He coloured the
merest trifle beneath his tan.</p>

<p>“Restfulness,” said Elizabeth gravely, “is
delightful.”</p>

<p>But she wasn’t deceived, not a bit of it. Neither
the pleasantness of Malford, nor its restfulness
was accountable for that particular exuberance in
John. It was a subtle, indefinable exuberance,
which no amount of mere bodily health could
cause. It emanated from his mind, his spirit;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>it surrounded him; he was bathed in it. He
might pretend to its non-existence; he might pretend&mdash;allowing
it&mdash;that it was the mere outcome
of a country life, but Elizabeth was not deceived.</p>

<p>“Have you met the Delanceys?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he responded airily enough.
“They’re&mdash;you’ll like them. That rumour you
got hold of was correct enough, by the way. There
is a claimant. He’s proved his claim. It’s a mere
matter of courtesy on his part that he is not
already in possession. He will be by the end of
the autumn.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth sat up.</p>

<p>“An American?” she said.</p>

<p>“An American,” said John. “At least he
hailed originally from the States. He has been
living in Africa since his boyhood.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he’s quite impossible?” said Elizabeth
frowning.</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” owned John reluctantly,
“he isn’t at all impossible, at any rate not in one
way. Of course he’ll be entirely unsuited to his
surroundings, but he is quite a decent fellow in
himself.”</p>

<p>“Brr!” breathed Elizabeth, and there was a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>hint of impatience in the sound. “A kangaroo
is a decent animal in itself, but you don’t want
it in your drawing-room. What do the Delanceys
think about it?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” quoth John, “they accept the inevitable.
There’s a strong hint of the French aristocrats’
attitude towards the guillotine, in their manner;
lacking, however, the scorn.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Elizabeth fell into meditation.</p>

<p>“I don’t think even you can reconstruct matters,”
said John smiling. “You see, the whole
thing turns on that missing document.”</p>

<p>“The whole thing,” said Elizabeth, “is so
blatantly melodramatic as to be barely respectable.”</p>

<p>John laughed.</p>

<p>“Wait till you see Lady Mary,” he said.
“She saves the situation completely.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was silent. Then:</p>

<p>“Where is the man now?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Staying at the Green Man,” said John.
“I’ve had to take a room there for you. You’ll
breakfast at the inn, and have the rest of your
meals with us. I am sorry there isn’t another
room at the White Cottage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t apologize,” said Elizabeth gaily. “I
came down to picnic. It’s I who should apologize
for thrusting myself upon you.”</p>

<p>“That,” said John decidedly, “is pure nonsense.”</p>

<p>They were ascending a hill by now. Twilight
was falling rapidly. Bats flew through the dusk,
their shrill queer note breaking the silence. A
great white owl flew noiselessly, like a huge moth,
across a field. The road was a white line between
dark hedges.</p>

<p>Coming to the top of the hill, wide stretches of
moorland lay around them. Far off on the
horizon was a strip of silver-grey sea. In the
middle distance was a hill, wood-covered, dark
towers rising among the trees.</p>

<p>“Delancey Castle,” said John.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI<br />
<span class="smaller">IN THE EARLY MORNING</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">If</span>, as I remarked at the beginning of a preceding
chapter, John thought it a funny world, it is very
certain that David would have fully endorsed his
opinion; and, further, he would have considered
himself the queerest person in it.</p>

<p>Now, this was purely owing to the fact that he
had suddenly found himself a stranger to himself.
It was, in a manner, as if he had lived in blindness
with a man for years, having, perhaps, without
fully recognizing the fact, some mental conception
of him. Then, on being miraculously restored
to sight, he had discovered that the reality
was totally at variance with that same mental
conception.</p>

<p>The recovery of sight had come gradually. It
had not been an instantaneous miracle. At the
first he thought, doubtless, if he considered the
fact at all, and he was probably only partially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>aware of it, that the variance between the reality
and what his partially restored sight beheld, was
due to his own faulty vision. Now, with clear
sight restored, he beheld a complete stranger, and
it left him bewildered. He didn’t know the man
at all. He didn’t even recognize his speech. It is
small wonder that he was bewildered; it is small
wonder that he spent solitary hours in a futile
attempt to reconstruct his preconceived notions
of the man.</p>

<p>I believe that the moment when David got a
first blurred glimpse of this stranger, was in
Father Maloney’s odd little parlour. He had had
another glimpse of him at the Castle; and since
then, little by little, the glimpses had resolved
themselves into full vision. And through it all,
with it all, was a queer sense of vibratory forces at
work.</p>

<p>It was in the parlour, also, that the first vibration
had struck upon him&mdash;a quite definite vibration,
though inexplicable. It had rung clearly for
a brief space, gradually growing fainter, till he
wondered if it had indeed rung, or was merely
imagination on his part. It had been repeated at
the Castle, and had left no doubt in his mind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>Since then it had been renewed at intervals,
ringing each time longer and louder. I can best
describe it as some kind of mental telephone call,
though he was, at present, at a complete loss as to
the message waiting to be delivered.</p>

<p>“The fact is, David P. Delancey,” he remarked
more than once, “that somehow your moorings
have been cut, and the Lord only knows where you
are drifting.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Very early in the morning, the sun not far above
the horizon, and the trees casting long shadows on
the grass, David set out for a walk.</p>

<p>It was by no means the first time that he had
risen thus betimes. The clean, fresh spirit of the
morning appealed to him, also its detachment. It
seemed, at that hour, so extraordinarily aloof
from the affairs of men, wrapped, in a sense, in its
own quiet meditations. Later the sun, the little
breezes, the sweet earth scents seemed to give
forth warmth, freshness, and fragrant odours for
the benefit of mankind. At this hour it was
wrapped in meditation, a meditation approaching
ecstasy.</p>

<p>He went softly, fearing almost to disturb the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>stillness, yet he did not altogether feel himself an
intruder. There was, in a strange sense, something
of communion between his spirit and the spirit of
the silent morning, in spite of its detachment.</p>

<p>The route he had chosen led first across the
moorland,&mdash;wide stretches of purple heather. He
walked without indulging in any special train of
thought. His eyes were open to the details of
nature around him, his brain alert to absorb them
in pure pleasure.</p>

<p>Gorse bushes, scattered among the heather,
showed golden blossoms backgrounded by a blue
sky. Their sweet scent came faintly to him. Later
in the stronger warmth of the sun, the scent would
gain in power and fulness. In the distance,
scattered copses lay misty blue patches on sun-gold
hillsides. Both far and near was an all-absorbing
peace.</p>

<p>He hadn’t a notion how far he walked, nor for
how long. Unconsciously he circled, coming at
length to a gate, leading into a larch wood.</p>

<p>David turned through it. Here the sun filtered
through the branches, flung spots of gold on the
red-brown earth of the pathway, on the emerald
of the moss lying in great patches among bracken,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>fern, and bramble. Twigs and branches, at one
time wind-torn from the trees, lay in the path,
silver-grey, lichen-covered. It was all intensely
silent, intensely still. David, stepping by chance
on a dried twig, heard it snap with the report of a
small pistol in the silence. The loneliness appealed
to him; the enchantment of the quiet wood led
him on.</p>

<p>Gradually, imperceptibly, his thoughts left externals,
turned inwards. Still aware of all that
lay around him, they were no longer merely idly
diffused upon it; they drew together, focussed.
Accustomed to think, though vaguely, in terms of
simile rather than in words, he saw in the quiet of
the wood something of the quiet which at present
held his own life and being. In a sense he suddenly
felt himself sleeping, his eyes closed on all that lay
behind him. Yet while sleeping, he knew, too,
that presently must come awakening. It was in
his power, he now felt, to awake at the moment
to the old life, as he knew it, to reconstruct his
mental conception of that stranger, as it was in his
power to retrace his steps. Yet it was almost as if
something external to himself waited with him, to
withdraw gently should he turn back, to remain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>with him should he go forward. So for a space of
time&mdash;a space not measured by the ticking of a
clock&mdash;David waited. Then suddenly he moved
onward down the glade.</p>

<p>And now he knew that his heart was beating
fast, pulsing with some curious excitement, though
he had not realized it before. His breath, too, was
coming rather quickly, like that of a man who has
been running. Gradually breathing and heart-beating
became normal; yet still the dream
sense lingered with him, and he did not want to
dispel it.</p>

<p>The path led him into a cuplike hollow among
the trees, a moss-grown place, full of deep shadows
and a pleasant coolness. On the other side of the
hollow the path ascended, through a beech-wood
here, silver-green trunks in strong contrast to the
deep red of the pathway. Though quiet, this
wood was vivid, full of stronger colour than was
that on the other side of the hollow.</p>

<p>Coming out at last from among the trees, David
found himself on an expanse of grass, on one side
skirted by the wood, on the other bordered by a
hedge of yew, close and thick and dark. Turning
to the left, he walked over the grass, till presently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>the hedge gave place to a low wicket gate. Here
he paused, looking over.</p>

<p>Beyond the hedge was a grey stone building, and
beyond the building were grey towers. He knew
now where he was. It was the chapel of Delancey
Castle facing him. He stood for a moment or so,
his hand resting on the gate.</p>

<p>Suddenly the chapel bell broke the silence.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE NOTE OF A BELL</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> bell rang three strokes, with a pause between
each. There was a longer pause. Then once more
came its threefold note.</p>

<p>The sound struck strangely on David’s ear, and
more strangely still on his heart. With the sound
he became extraordinarily aware of some vital
Presence near at hand. Something that suffused
the whole atmosphere with Its Personality.</p>

<p>Somehow the quiet of the morning, its meditation,
its silent ecstasy, seemed to have been leading
up to that moment. It seemed to him now that
here was the moment for which the morning had
been waiting, and he with the morning. Neither
did the moment pass; it remained, prolonged,
expanded. Time again vanished; there was no
time, there was nothing but himself and that
extraordinary mystical sense which was suffusing
the atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>He made no attempt to explain it; he couldn’t
have explained it had he tried. It was something
beyond words, beyond reason, beyond feeling,
even, in the ordinary sense of the term. It was
not actually in his mind that he was aware of it at
all, but in something far deeper. In one way it was
as if the notes of that bell had struck on some deep
recess of his soul, setting free some tiny spring
of hidden knowledge and sweetness; and yet he
knew that it was not by virtue of that knowledge
and sweetness that the mystical sense suffusing
the atmosphere had been translated into terms of
fact. It was external to them; it was actual, real,
palpitating. He knew that it would have been
there had the well of his inner consciousness
remained untouched. Only somehow, in some
extraordinary manner, it had sprung up to meet
it; and the tiny freed spring had been caught into
great waters, submerging him in a sweetness he
could not understand.</p>

<p>I don’t know how long David stood by the
wicket gate; but, at last, barely conscious of his
surroundings, he turned from it along the grass
sward.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE GREEN MAN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> parlour at the Green Man is the parlour
pure and simple. It calls itself by no grand-sounding
title. You eat there, you sit there to
smoke and talk&mdash;if you do not sit in the garden,
and you write there.</p>

<p>It has five round tables, deal, and covered with
strong white cloths. It has rush-bottomed chairs;
it has casement windows; it has a great fireplace
with oak settles on either side of it. For the rest,
the walls are buff-washed, and hung with coloured
prints, mainly of a sporting nature. The floor is
red stone, with three mats on it. The mats
are made of small loose strips of coloured stuff.
The window curtains are of highly coloured
chintz.</p>

<p>The front door of the Green Man stands flush
with the cobbled pavement. Above the door
swings the square sign with the name painted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>thereon. It is a question, in Malford, from whence
that name has originated. The oldest inhabitants
of the place, in particular Mrs. Joan Selby, who
has passed her ninetieth birthday, will tell you
that it is in honour of the Little People, who,
long years since, footed it in the moonlight on the
grassy hill behind the house. She will declare
that she had it from the present owner’s great-grandfather
himself, that the first visitor to the
house, when it was yet unnamed, was a little man,
clad in green, red-capped, who promised luck in his
own name and that of his Tribe.</p>

<p>This, you may believe, is looked upon as sheer
superstition by the younger and more enlightened
of the inhabitants of Malford. There is one ribald
wag, who declares that the name originated
through the verdant propensities of a former
owner.</p>

<p>But for my part I lean to the first theory. And if
you had ever sat in the moonlight on the grassy
hill behind the house, had seen the dark green of
the fairy rings among the brighter green of the
field, had heard the rippling of the stream at the
foot of the hill, had seen the pale gold of the massed
primroses, had smelled their sweet fragrant scent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>had seen the misty shimmer of countless bluebells,
then, I fancy, you also would have been of my way
of thinking.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Elizabeth sat at one of the round tables by an
open casement window.</p>

<p>It looked on to a grass terrace bordered
by brilliant galadias. Beyond the galadias was
a tiny stream, rippling, amber-coloured, over
rounded stones. Beyond the stream was a grassy
hill, sloping upwards to a beech-wood. Beyond
that again was the blue sky.</p>

<p>“It really is extraordinarily pleasant,” said
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>And then she turned to her coffee pot. The
coffee poured into a blue and white cup, she was
stirring it thoughtfully, when the door opened.</p>

<p>A man paused for the merest fraction of a second
on the threshold. It evidently came as a bit of a
surprise to him to find the room already occupied.</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked at the man. The man looked
at Elizabeth.</p>

<p>She saw a big man in loose tweeds, shabby
tweeds, which had seen much service. She saw a
square-faced man, with a mat of darkish red hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>He saw a glossy-haired, brown-haired woman, a
woman with a palely bronzed skin, beneath which
there was an underglow of red, a woman with red
lips finely moulded, with a square chin, with a
delicately chiselled nose, with steady grey eyes
in which there was an under-note of something
akin to laughter. She wore a cream-coloured
cotton dress. A pink la France rose was tucked
into the front of her gown.</p>

<p>David, used to the rapid assimilation of details,
saw all this at a glance. Then he crossed to the
table in the other window. It had been laid so
that it faced hers, and fearing lest he should appear
guilty of an obtrusive staring, he gazed out of the
window.</p>

<p>The arrival of his breakfast providing occupation
for hands and eyes, David turned to the table.
A moment later he found that the sugar had been
forgotten.</p>

<p>Now, the Green Man is devoid of bells. In
some ways it is distinctly primitive. A brass
knocker on the front door announces the arrival
of visitors. For the rest your own vocal cords are
employed.</p>

<p>Ordinarily David would have gone to the door
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>and shouted, but the presence of Elizabeth causing
some absurd little diffidence in his mind, he sipped
his coffee unsweetened. To a sweet-toothed man
non-sugared coffee is peculiarly unpalatable. He
set down his cup with a half-grimace, and glanced
round the room. By good luck there might be a
sugar bowl on an unoccupied table. There was not.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had noticed the former hesitation; she
had likewise noticed the slight grimace, and the
present unavailing glance around the room. Two
and two were put rapidly together in her mind.
She gave her own sugar bowl a slight push.</p>

<p>“Here is some sugar,” said she in her pleasant
voice.</p>

<p>It was a most trifling incident. At the moment
David merely said “Thank you,” and availed
himself of the proffered bowl. Twenty minutes
later, meeting in the garden by the stream, it gave
a slight excuse for speech. It gave Elizabeth the
excuse for speech. You may be sure David would
never have ventured on it.</p>

<p>“What a dreamy spot!” said she, turning with a
smile.</p>

<p>If you knew Elizabeth well, you would know
that this was one of her favourite adjectives. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>summed up at once beauty, picturesqueness,
colour, and entire enjoyment of anything.</p>

<p>“It is good,” said David briefly.</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s eyes twinkled. She liked the
speech. It was in this fashion, so we are told, that
God regarded His Creation,&mdash;that is before Mother
Eve, beguiled by the old Serpent, had upset
matters. Yet after all, in spite of his upsettings,
there are times and places which yet fill us with
some faint sense of that pristine perfection.</p>

<p>Of course Elizabeth knew perfectly well who
he was. That may well go without saying. But,
in spite of John having said that he was a decent
fellow, he wasn’t in the remotest degree like her
mental conception of him.</p>

<p>She had pictured him a big man&mdash;which he
truly was, also a bluff man, a jovial man, a talker,
a bit loud-voiced, perhaps a trifle assertive, at
all events very confident of himself, and all these
things he was not. It had not taxed Elizabeth’s
intuition very vastly to perceive that, contrary to
all her expectations, there was an extraordinary
diffidence about him. He wasn’t the least certain
of himself, he wasn’t the least jovial nor loud-voiced,
while something in his eyes,&mdash;well, I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>mentioned his eyes before. Somehow Elizabeth’s
mind swung to her little dusty-haired, grey-eyed
Patrick in Ireland. She saw him in the throes of
grappling with one of those world problems to
which the cleverest of us can find but a poor
answer, heard a small voice say wearily:</p>

<p>“Mummy, there is some things what is very
difficult to understand.”</p>

<p>Of course it was an absurd comparison. What
had this big man in common with the perplexities
of a childish mind? Nevertheless for a brief
space she <i>had</i> thought of Patrick.</p>

<p>“You can almost,” said Elizabeth, “see the
Good Folk come trooping down that hill.</p>

<p>Patrick had once said nearly these very

<p>“They don’t sound altogether friendly,” said
David as she stopped.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she assured him, “they are only unfriendly
towards those who dislike and fear them.
Those who fear them have to be constantly propitiating
them. There’s nothing they hate like
fear, and therefore they demand toll from cowards.
For those who love the Little People&mdash;you should
hear my small son Patrick talk about them,” she
ended.</p>

<p>David looked a trifle bewildered.</p>

<p>“Do you truly believe&mdash;” he began.</p>

<p>She looked at him, half-laughing, half-serious.</p>

<p>“Honestly I don’t know,” she said. “I’m
living in the depths of Ireland, and all that kind of
thing is infectious. Sometimes I laugh at myself
for giving it a moment’s thought, and the next I’m
saying, there must be <i>something</i> in it. As for
Patrick, you’d as easily shake his belief in me as
his belief in the Good People. After all, who
knows? He says <i>he</i> does. But then children
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>may have the key to a door of which we know
nothing, or, at the best, but fancy we have caught
a glimpse.”</p>

<p>There was a little silence, broken only by the
sound of running water.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Elizabeth, “I must unpack.
I was too lazy last night. My evening frock will
be crushed out of all recognition.”</p>

<p>David pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know people wore evening dress in the
country,” said he.</p>

<p>Elizabeth laughed.</p>

<p>“John&mdash;my brother, Mr. Mortimer&mdash;does,” she
replied. “I believe he’d sooner go without his
dinner than omit dressing for it.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Mortimer!” ejaculated David. “Do you
mean that?” The gravity of his tone seemed
unwarranted by the triviality of the question.</p>

<p>“Mean it? Of course I do,” replied Elizabeth.</p>

<p>And then she saw his face.</p>

<p>“What on earth does it mean?” thought Elizabeth
to herself.</p>

<p>“Glory be to God, you’ve done it now!” Father
Maloney would have exclaimed.</p>

<p>Already her presence was making itself felt.</p>

<span class="smaller">ELIZABETH GIVES ADVICE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">“I’ve</span> seen the interloper,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>She was walking with John by the river. He
had called for her at the Green Man, and had
proposed a walk.</p>

<p>“Yes?” said John. There was enquiry in his
tone.</p>

<p>“He isn’t,” said Elizabeth, “in the remotest
degree what I imagined him, except for his size.
He&mdash;well, it is extraordinarily difficult to describe
him.”</p>

<p>“You feel that?”</p>

<p>“There’s something so childlike about him,”
pursued Elizabeth. “If I were to attempt to put
into words what I mean, he seems to me like a
child, who had started out to get something,
entirely sure that he wanted it; and then, when he
found it in his grasp, he discovered it to be totally
different from what he imagined it. He expected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>a sort of toy, and he has found an enormous responsibility.
He doesn’t know what to make of it.
He is utterly perplexed, and it hasn’t occurred to
him that the simplest plan would be to renounce it.”</p>

<p>John opened eyes of wonder.</p>

<p>“I always knew you were shrewd, my dear
Elizabeth,” he remarked, “but how you have
arrived at these conclusions in so brief a space of
time, beats me altogether.”</p>

<p>“Then you think I’m right?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I am pretty sure of it. But the thing is, that
he sees the responsibility without exactly recognizing
it, and, as you say, the simple way out of the
difficulty hasn’t occurred to him in consequence.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth mused, looking at the running water.</p>

<p>“But that’s not all,” she went on. “There’s
more I can’t fathom. These are merely material
difficulties to grapple with. He is faced with
something deeper. You can call me absurd if you
like. I daresay I am being a little <i>exalté</i>, but he
has a look in his eyes as if he had caught a glimpse
of the Vision Beautiful, and he is a bit bewildered.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said John quietly, “I’ll not call you
absurd.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth cast a quick look at him and lapsed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>into silence. The second problem was already
absorbing her vastly more than the first. It was
infinitely greater, the issue infinitely more important.
To the first problem, when David had once
grasped it fairly, there was so simple a solution,
did he but choose to take it. In any case, however,
it was, to her mind, on another plane. It didn’t
belong to the same category as this second problem.
Of course you may say that the mental problem
existed solely in Elizabeth’s imagination. But
then she did not think it did; nor, you will realize,
did John.</p>

<p>Suddenly she spoke again, and quite irrelevantly
to her former remarks.</p>

<p>“What particular interest has&mdash;Sir David, I
suppose I must call him, in dress clothes?”</p>

<p>“Dress clothes?” queried John bewildered.</p>

<p>“Dress clothes,” reiterated Elizabeth. “I
happened to say&mdash;quite idly, you understand,&mdash;that
you’d sooner go without your dinner than not
dress for it. He asked me if I meant that, and
when I replied that I did, I saw at once that, far
from being the little trivial matter I had believed
it, it was, to him, of the most vital and grave
importance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Elizabeth!” John’s eyebrows
went up. He gazed at his sister in comical dismay.</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Elizabeth. “You would.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I daresay,” said John ruefully. “But&mdash;well,
the man hasn’t a dress suit. Apparently he
doesn’t possess such a thing, and Father Maloney
swore that it was an entirely unnecessary article
in the country. Corin and I dined at Delancey
Castle in morning dress to keep him in countenance.
And now you&mdash;” he broke off.</p>

<p>Contrition, profound and utter contrition, wrote
itself on Elizabeth’s face.</p>

<p>“I ought to have guessed there was something
momentous in the question,” she said remorsefully,
“and yet how could I! How small I must
have made him feel!”</p>

<p>“And what a cheat he must think Father
Maloney!” said John grimly. “He’ll believe we
were all laughing at him in our sleeves.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t rub it in,” groaned Elizabeth.
“These kind of horrid little <i>contretemps</i> make one
feel guiltier and more remorseful than quite a good-sized
venial sin. You needn’t tell me I’ve no business
to feel like that. Of course I haven’t. But
kindly remember it’s only in my feelings and not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>in my reason, I’m experiencing the sensation.
What can I do? Tell him I was only joking?”</p>

<p>“He’ll not believe you,” John assured her,
“though certainly your remark was, I trust, not
intended to be taken in deadly earnest. Perhaps,”
continued John hopefully, “it may open his eyes a
little more to his unsuitability for the position of
head of Delancey Castle.”</p>

<p>“It may,” said Elizabeth succinctly, “but all
the same I wish I hadn’t lent a hand to the operation.
It’s nearly as bad as forcing open the eyes
of a two-days-old kitten. I’d far sooner have left
the business to time.”</p>

<p>“Time,” remarked John gloomily, “is an old
cheat. You never know what he will be up to.
He has a way of contracting hours into briefest
seconds when you want their full value, and of
expanding them into an eternity when you’ve no
use for them. Oh! he’s a wily beggar is Time.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth laughed.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked. “Hadn’t you better
make a clean breast of it?”</p>

<p>“Of what?” demanded John evasively.</p>

<p>“The exact manner of Time’s trickery,” responded
Elizabeth. “Or anything else you please.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>Of course I know there’s something on your
mind.”</p>

<p>“You profess to be a reader of minds?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” smiled Elizabeth. “Only,
having eyes in my head, I use them. Also, having
been endowed with a certain amount of intelligence
I use that also. And adding the two together&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You have guessed?” queried John.</p>

<p>“A dim guess,” said Elizabeth, “and one which
will find no outlet in speech without further proof.”</p>

<p>She sat down on a tree trunk.</p>

<p>“Let us rest,” said she.</p>

<p>John stretched himself on the grass at her
feet.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “perhaps your guess is right.”</p>

<p>“There is someone?” she demanded, promptly
forgetting her former announcement.</p>

<p>John nodded.</p>

<p>“Ah!” Elizabeth’s eyes gleamed. “And of
course it can only be the one someone. I am
glad.”</p>

<p>“So would I be,” returned John, “if it weren’t
such a one-sided affair.”</p>

<p>“You mean that she doesn’t&mdash;” Elizabeth
broke off, dismay in voice and eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” said John gloomily. “How
can I tell? She’s friendly, she’s&mdash;she’s adorable,
but&mdash;” He flung out his hand, as who should say,
“And there’s the whole of it.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t asked her?”</p>

<p>“Asked her!” John’s tone was almost scornful.
“Where’s your intuition, my dear sister? Wouldn’t
you see me in permanent radiant joy, or black
despair, if I had? As it is, I am swinging from the
one to the other, and the swing of the pendulum
stays down infinitely longer than it stays up.
There’s old Time at his games.” He pulled at the
rushes by the river bank.</p>

<p>“But,” quoth Elizabeth calmly, “why don’t
you ask her?”</p>

<p>“Ask her! I have not known her a fortnight
yet. I have only seen her eight times.”</p>

<p>“It has been enough for you,” said Elizabeth,
still calmly.</p>

<p>“For me, yes,” allowed John. “But for
her! There’s the crux of the matter. What
have I got to offer her?” His tone was despairing.</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked at him. There was the gleam
of a tender smile in her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>“Just the one thing,” she said softly, “that is of
the smallest value. Yourself.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;” began John.</p>

<p>Elizabeth interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Listen,” she said, and there was a curious
earnestness in her voice, “if she doesn’t care for
you yourself, nothing else you could offer would
have the smallest value in her eyes. At least, not
if she’s the woman I take her to be. And she
must be that woman, or I don’t for a moment
believe you would love her. Oh, John, dear, don’t
you understand that women, the right kind of
women, don’t want the external things a man can
give? They want him himself, and the things
that are part of him, the things without which he
wouldn’t be himself at all. I mean love, loyalty,
friendship. I don’t believe the majority of people
have a notion how important the last is. That is
why there are so few ideal marriages.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” mused John.</p>

<p>“It’s true,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Then what is your advice?” demanded John.</p>

<p>“Ask her, of course.” Elizabeth’s tone was
refreshingly certain. “You can’t expect her to
propose, can you? How do you know that Time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>isn’t playing exactly the same tricks with her?
Ask her,” reiterated Elizabeth, “at the very first
opportune moment.”</p>

<p>“That,” said John laughing ruefully, “is
precisely what I have been waiting for.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE BURDEN OF CONVENTIONALITY</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Of</span> course you will have realized that Elizabeth’s
surmise regarding David was entirely correct.</p>

<p>When he made his material embarkation at
Cape Town he hadn’t the faintest conception of
the mental voyage on which he was embarking,
or I am pretty sure he would never have set foot
on the ship’s deck, or, at all events would have
done so with misgiving. And he had had none.
Gay as a schoolboy in quest of adventure, and
determined as that youngster, he had watched
the African coast recede from his sight, had
seen Table Mountain dwindle to a mere speck,
had turned his face in the direction of his new
enterprise.</p>

<p>First had come the tracing up of his family in
America, a tedious enough job, leading him
eventually to Brussels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>His arrival in London had brought further
business in its train, interviewing solicitors;
producing the proofs collected through months of
research; answering endless, and what appeared
to him totally irrelevant, questions. Next there
had been waiting,&mdash;waiting in shabby little rooms
in Chelsea, when he beguiled the weary hours by
walks on the Embankment, in Battersea Park, or
on Hampstead Heath, anywhere away from the
interminable hum of traffic, from the ceaseless
stream of people.</p>

<p>More than once he had asked himself what on
earth he had done it for? Why he had left the
quiet, the sunshine, the colour, the wide spaces of
the veldt, for the noise, the fog, the greyness, the
confinement of London. More than once he had
called himself a fool for his pains, cursed the day
idleness had taken him to rummage in the old
chest in the storeroom.</p>

<p>Then, the swing of the pendulum lifting him
towards the anticipation of fulfilled hope, his
gloom would be dispelled. After all, he would
assure himself, it was his birthright for which he
was enduring hardship. Only a fool or a weakling
would have refused to take up the clue he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>inadvertently discovered. Then, gloom once more
overwhelming him, he would demand of himself:
Was it his birthright? After all didn’t this same
birthright lie in the wide untrammelled spaces of
the veldt, the unconventional surroundings, the
life of freedom? Wasn’t he attempting to exchange
it for a mess of red pottage?</p>

<p>But, with the arrival of the long-looked-for
document, legal phrases and all, doubts again
dispersed. He had laboured, he had toiled, he had
achieved. There was no question now about that
birthright. It was his. He held it as surely in his
grasp as he held that piece of foolscap paper.</p>

<p>Naturally the first thing to do was to go and
have a look at it. He had refrained from so doing
till his rights thereto had been assured. He bade
a far from reluctant farewell to his shabby rooms,
and a not overclean landlady, took the train forthwith
to Whortley, arrived at Malford, and the
Green Man.</p>

<p>And then gradually, imperceptibly, all his
doubts had returned, returned, too, in so subtle a
manner, that he hardly recognized them for doubts.
He was merely bewildered, non-understanding of
himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>It seemed to him totally absurd that he should
not be entirely delighted at the thought of his
inheritance, yet, if the truth be known, it was
beginning to hang like a somewhat weighty millstone
round his neck. And the exceeding simple
solution of cutting the string that held it there,
never dawned upon him.</p>

<p>Perhaps, unconsciously, he felt that to do so
would be to shirk responsibility; but it is very
certain that he was already devoutly wishing
that he had never sought responsibility. Elizabeth’s
careless little remark had added quite an
appreciable weight to it. It is astonishing how the
merest fragment added to an already heavy load
will make it almost insupportable. It was, too,
the absurdest fragment, the most ridiculous
fragment, but there it was, flung carelessly upon
him. Mentally, though vaguely, he saw a million
other like fragments, which he told himself shudderingly
would be added. He saw at least another
ton load waiting for him. To those used to these
burdens of conventionality they would be a mere
featherweight. But to him!</p>

<p>He began to enumerate the list, to drag forth
to clearer vision what he was vaguely perceiving.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>To this end he recalled his dinner at Delancey
Castle.</p>

<p>Dress clothes headed the list. True, they had
not been present, but then they should have been.
His own ignorance would evidently be a very
formidable fragment. Well then, number one,
dress clothes, stiff collars and shirt fronts, and all
the rest of the paraphernalia. Number two,
servants standing in the room while you eat. An
abomination! Number three, servants handing
you food in silver dishes. An idiotic custom! Why
couldn’t they put the things on the table? Number
four, accept everything offered you as indifferently
as possible. Avoid thanking a servant.
Well, with a bit of practice he might manage that.
Number five, water placed before you in glass
dishes, which water you were evidently not intended
to drink,&mdash;he had grasped that much. A
purely silly convention. Number six, coffee in
minute cups that slid about on the saucers, and
nowhere to put the elusive fragile things. David
went hot and cold at the remembrance. Number
seven, no pipes in the drawing-room. He groaned.
This much his own experience had taught him,
and taught him within the space of a couple of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>hours. And Heaven alone knew how many more
fragments there might not be.</p>

<p>Of course you might argue, and justly, why
think of these conventions at all? Brush them
aside. Treat them as non-existent. He was his
own master. That is logical and sound reasoning.</p>

<p>But no. To David’s mind it behooved him, in
accepting the responsibility, to accept with it all
that appertained thereto. Herein lay that touch
of simplicity, that touch of childlikeness, which,
perhaps you may have perceived in him. Therefore
it is small wonder that civilization was bearing
heavily upon him.</p>

<p>Truly a sorry state for a man.</p>

<span class="smaller">CONSPIRATORS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> was talking to Mrs. Trimwell.</p>

<p>She was sitting in a low chair by the open back
door. The baby lay in her lap, peacefully sucking
a small pink thumb, round eyes gazing at Elizabeth’s
face the while. The baby was as at home
with Elizabeth, as Elizabeth was at home with the
baby.</p>

<p>Before them lay the garden,&mdash;cabbages, potatoes,
and onions neatly surrounded by flower
borders. On a clothes-line, white pinafores and
little blue and pink cotton frocks swung gently in
the breeze.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell was at the ironing-table, but it is
very certain that the work of her hands in no way
impeded the action of her tongue. Every now
and then she turned from the table to the stove,
exchanging a cooling iron for one which she would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>momentarily hold in what appeared to be dangerous
proximity to her cheek. Then down it would
go on to the crumpled linen, which smoothed to
snowy whiteness beneath the magic of her touch.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have said it to no one but you,
ma’am,” remarked Mrs. Trimwell, in conclusion,
it would appear, to some foregoing speech, “but
I do say as how a helping hand at the moment
would be a godsend to the poor young gentleman.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked entire agreement.</p>

<p>“Yes,” quoth she. “But then, what right have
<i>I</i> to interfere.”</p>

<p>“Lor’ bless you, ma’am,” ejaculated Mrs.
Trimwell, “if we was all to wait for our rights to
make a move, I reckon there’d be precious little
moving. When you think you’ve got a right
there’s a dozen folk will tell you you haven’t got
none. And when you’re for letting a job be,
they’ll all be giving you a shift towards it. And
spending the time arguing about it is mostly like
talking over who’s got the best right to throw a
rope to a drowning man. It’s the handiest has
got to do it, I’m thinking, and let rights take their
chance.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Elizabeth, and her eyes were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>smiling, though her voice was sufficiently grave,
“supposing he doesn’t want any interference.”</p>

<p>“There’s a deal of folk as don’t know what’s
good for them,” remarked Mrs. Trimwell dryly,
“and maybe he’s one of the number, though I’m
not for that way of thinking myself. To my mind
he has got hisself into a bit of a boggle, and don’t
know the way out, though ’tis as plain as the nose
on my face.”</p>

<p>She folded a table-cloth with rapid dexterity.</p>

<p>“But,” argued Elizabeth, and she patted the
baby gently, “if I broach the subject when he
doesn’t want it broached, what will he think of
me?”</p>

<p>“Same as most men,” returned Mrs. Trimwell
calmly, whisking a handkerchief from a basket,
“that women’s for ever busy over what ain’t no
concern of theirs. But Lor’ bless you, what does
that matter! If we’re so everlasting prudent as
to wait for chances to be certainties, we’ll miss
giving a sight of help. There’s fifty chances in a
month to one certainty, and the chances want a
friend’s hand to them a precious sight more
than the certainties.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked down the garden. Slowly she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>patted the tranquil baby; slowly she pondered on
this last statement. She was disposed to see quite
a fair amount of truth in it. But then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“What exactly do you advise?” Her eyes held
a gleam of amusement.</p>

<p>“Talk to him straight,” said Mrs. Trimwell
briefly. “I’ll own I wasn’t for having him miss his
chances myself at first, but now&mdash;Lor’ bless you!
I see ’tis no chance but a trap he’s laid hold on, and
he’ll be caught sure enough before he’s done, if
someone doesn’t speak.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes,” demurred Elizabeth, the little gleam
lighting to laughter, “but how? What, for instance,
would you say under the circumstances?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell put her iron on the stove. She
turned deliberately to Elizabeth. Brows frowning
she sought for inspiration.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t rightly say as I’m a good hand at
fashioning speeches. Leastways not the kind as’ll
take with gentle-folk. But I reckon it’s something
after this way I’d speak.”</p>

<p>One hand on hip, the other shaking an admonitory
finger at an imaginary young man, Mrs.
Trimwell proceeded.</p>

<p>“Young sir, seeing as how you ain’t got no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>friends handy to tell you the truth, which may be
unpalatable, but which I’m thinking you needs the
taste of, I’m speaking in the friend’s place. It
don’t require no mighty sharp sight to see that
you’re as uneasy as a cat on hot bricks in contemplating
the situation before you, the situation
being one which you ain’t been brought up to, and
as different from the life you’ve led as chalk is from
cheese. It ain’t no use trying to bend a tree to
new shapes when it’s full-growed, leastways if you
do, you run a pretty fair risk of breaking it, and
that’s what’s going to happen to you. ’Tisn’t as
though you’d been took in childhood, when the
bending to new ways can be done without over
much harm. Lor’ bless you, can’t you see what
you’re trying to do with yourself? ’Twill be like
putting a sea fish in one of them little glass bowls
you see in shops for you to try and get used to the
ways of folks like them at the Castle. They’s
born to it, and don’t feel all the finiky little things
that comes as easy to them as breathing. It’s
bigger things you’re wanting, and by that I’m not
meaning the size of the rooms, for you’ll find them
big enough at the Castle. It’s your mind you’ll be
shutting up, and your body too, for all the size
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>of the place. You’ve found a cage, that’s what
you’ve found, and partly because it’s a glittery
thing, and partly because it’s yours, you’re feeling
bound to live in it. Turn your back on it, I says;
leave it to them as doesn’t know the caging. ’Tis
God’s earth is your heritage, and not the castles
men folk have built on it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell paused.</p>

<p>“That’s the manner of talk I’d be giving him,”
she announced. “It’ll put things clear to him, and
he’s not got them over clear in his mind yet.
’Tis what he’s seeing though, half-blind like, and
it’s a friend he needs to open his eyes before ’tis
too late.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth gazed at her. There was admiration,
frank and genuine admiration, in her eyes. Of
course Mrs. Trimwell had merely voiced her own
entire opinion, but quite probably it was on this
very account that the admiration was thus unstinted.
There is the same curious pleasure in
finding another at one with you on a matter even
slightly near your heart, as there is in finding your
own unexpressed and half-articulate thoughts in
the pages of some book. Also there was admiration
for the fact that Mrs. Trimwell had arrived at so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>rapid a conclusion. Elizabeth totally forgot that
her own conclusion had been even more rapid.</p>

<p>“I shall never,” said Elizabeth, “be able to
speak with half your verve.”</p>

<p>Though totally ignorant of the last word, Mrs.
Trimwell was aware that same compliment was
intended.</p>

<p>“You’ll put it a sight more polished than I can,”
she remarked bluntly.</p>

<p>“He’d prefer the original speech,” smiled
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“But he’ll not get it,” Mrs. Trimwell’s voice
was grim. “I knows my place.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth raised amused eyebrows.</p>

<p>“And all the time you’ve been assuring me that
it isn’t a question of rights,” she protested.</p>

<p>“There’s rights and rights,” announced Mrs.
Trimwell, “and ’tis you’ve the bigger right than
me. You’re gentle-folk, same as he, and he’ll
take it better from you. I’d speak fast enough,
Lor’ bless you, if there wasn’t you to do it.”</p>

<p>She turned again to her ironing.</p>

<p>Elizabeth again took to patting the small bundle
of warmth in her lap. Over the low hedge of the
garden, she could see the churchyard, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>white and grey headstones of the graves. From
the old church came the intermittent sound of
hammering, and the occasional clinking of metal.
Pigeons wheeled against the blue sky, alighting
now and again on the church tower. Beyond
the church stretched meadows, and the silver line
of a river twisting among them past rushes and
pollard willows.</p>

<p>A heat haze covered the landscape; it shimmered,
elusively golden, above the red-flagged path of the
garden. A cat dozed on a bit of sun-baked earth;
it appeared the embodiment of feline contentment.
Elizabeth felt something of the same contentment.
There was still that little gleam of amusement
in her eyes.</p>

<p>Unquestionably she was a conspirator.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII<br />
<span class="smaller">CORIN TAKES A WALK</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is, however, one thing to be a conspirator in
intention, and quite another to put your conspiracy
into action. The opportunity perversely
refused to present itself, or, at any rate, to Elizabeth’s
eyes it refused to present itself, and that,
after all, came to the same thing. A dozen times
at least she went over her prepared formula in her
mind, intending at each meeting to put it into
words.</p>

<p>And there were meetings enough. You might
have imagined that David sought them; that
he knew, by some uncanny instinct, the exact
moments when Elizabeth would approach the
Green Man. Of course, too, there were the meetings
at breakfast, but to Elizabeth’s mind these
barely counted. It was not a subject to be served
up with coffee and eggs and bacon; the hour, also,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>was unpropitious. She was never glib of speech in
the early morning. But then every hour seemed
unpropitious.</p>

<p>The whole difficulty of the matter lay in the fact
that she was on the outlook for an opportunity,
that her formula was prepared. I defy any one&mdash;at
all events any one of Elizabeth’s truthful nature&mdash;to
introduce a pre-arranged subject casually and naturally.
If you have ever tried to do so yourself,
you will hear the instant ring of falsity in your words.</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And if you don’t begin in this fashion, how on
earth are you going to begin, I ask?</p>

<p>Every meeting which passed without the subject
being broached, lent further difficulty to its broaching.
And the moment the opportunity had gone
by, Elizabeth would upbraid herself for cowardice,
would speak confidently to her heart of next time.
And when next time came, the little dumb devil
would sit maliciously on guard before her lips
allowing every word to pass them but those she
desired to speak.</p>

<p>The matter became almost farcical; it would
have been farcical, but that the days were slipping
by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>“It’s positively absurd,” Elizabeth told herself,
half-laughing, half-angry.</p>

<p>But absurd or not, the little dumb devil was
keeping close watch.</p>

<p>And here it was that Fate or Providence stepped
in in a purely unexpected manner. Doubtless you,
according to your views, will give the credit to
whichever pleases you.</p>

<p>The intervention can hardly be termed direct.
But then, that is frequently the case. It is the side
issues, which in themselves appear of little or no
importance, which have a momentous influence on
the graver and deeper questions of life.</p>

<p>And here I am minded to quote the words
reflected upon by the sunny-hearted Pippa.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Say not ‘a small event!’ Why ‘small’?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Costs it more pain than this, ye call</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A ‘great event,’ should come to pass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than that? Untwine me from the mass</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of deeds which make up life, one deed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Power shall fall short in or exceed!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yet, if you should reply boldly in refutation of
these words, Here, in my life, is one deed, one
action at least, which stands paramount above
all others, I would answer, True; but what of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>so-called tiny influences, the so-called minute
events which led to it? Can you eliminate any
one of them, and then say with certainty that,
without it, the result would have been the same?
And if you can not, how can you declare that
the apparently tiny event was of less importance
than the one you call great?</p>

<p>However, let’s on to the matter in hand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Corin found the joys of scraping plaster off
walls beginning to pall. Apparently he had
come to an end of discovery.</p>

<p>It is one thing to delve for new treasures, it is
another to scrape for hours on end to find a mere
repetition of design. However delightful masonry
and herb Robert may be when it dawns freshly on
the sight, its continued contemplation waxes somewhat
stale. To his judging, and no doubt he
judged rightly, there were still yards and yards
of it to be uncovered. Monotony, therefore, crept
upon his soul. With a view, then, to relaxing
the monotony, and taking into consideration
that the sunshine without the church appeared
infinitely preferable to the gloom within, he laid
down his tools this particular afternoon a full
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>hour before his customary time, and came out into
the open.</p>

<p>And here, for a moment, he paused.</p>

<p>Before him, eight miles distant, lay Whortley,
to be reached by road or field, according to inclination.
He ruled out that notion promptly. To
the right lay the river, the silver ribbon bordered
by pollard willows; to the left lay wood and moorland;
behind him and the church lay the sea. It
was distant a mile or thereabouts, and the sun
was distinctly hot. But what of that! Wouldn’t
the music of its voice on the shore, the colour of
its sparkling waters, the coolness of the little breeze
that would sweep across its surface, be well worth
the tramp?</p>

<p>“The sea for me!” cried Corin to his heart.
“And that’s rhyme, and I’m not sure that it isn’t
poetry if you take into consideration the vision it
conjures up. In fact, taking that into consideration,
I am sure that it <i>is</i> poetry.”</p>

<p>Whereupon he wheeled around.</p>

<p>First the route lay uphill towards Delancey
Castle. It was a stiffish climb. The sun, beating
upon the white roadway, flung waves of heat up
from it. They shimmered before his spectacled,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>short-sighted eyes in an irritating glaring dance.
His round, cherubic face was glowing to a deep
crimson before he was half-way up the ascent.
The vision he had conjured up of the seashore
might truly be poetical, but I question the poetry
in the appearance of the little man trudging
towards that vision. Yet this is unkind. Who
are we to judge from appearances? Truly may
poetic aspirations be hidden beneath the most
unlikely exteriors.</p>

<p>At the top of the hill, Corin paused, looking
reflectively down the long avenue. Exhaustion
rather than reflection prompted the pause, nevertheless
he gave vent to a sage one.</p>

<p>“<i>Omne ignotum pro magnifico</i>,” he remarked,
“by which token, I fancy, our young American
friend down yonder had a very different conception
of what he was going to find up here. He has
found less magnificence than irksomeness, I take
it. Now, I wonder why karma&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But I refuse to follow Corin in his meditative
flights in this direction. It is sufficient to note
that we see him, from the remark I have given you,
in like mind with three at least of our other characters
herein mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>His meditation on the mysteries of karma
completed, and his exhaustion being in part, at
least, lessened, Corin pursued his way. His route
was level now, leading presently to a footpath
across an expanse of short grass. Here he came
upon full view of the sea&mdash;blue, sparkling, radiant,
dotted with white- and red-winged sailing boats.</p>

<p>Coming at length to a rough, descending track,
he made his way down it. It brought him into a
cove, a place of white sand, smooth and gleaming.</p>

<p>Truly here was all that his vision had expected.
The grass-crowned cliffs sloped down to the cove
in rugged grey walls, samphire-covered. Nor did
the grey rocks stop abruptly on reaching the
white sand, but ran out into it, as if eager to gain
to the sun-kissed water. Little pools lay among
them, mirrors reflecting the blue of the sky. In
the pools waved feathery fronds of sea-weed&mdash;pink,
crimson, and brown; tiny silver fish darted hither
and thither; sea anemones stretched forth dainty
flower-like tentacles.</p>

<p>“This,” remarked Corin to his soul, “was worth
the tramp.”</p>

<p>And he sat down on the warm white sand.</p>

<p>There wasn’t a soul in sight; nothing but those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>white- and red-winged boats, making a lazy headway
with the tide, to remind him of his fellow
mortals, and they but added to the beauty of
the picture. The water broke in baby waves
on the shore, with the faintest musical ripple.
Sea-gulls dipped to the shining surface, or floated
smoothly in the blueness above. Now and again
a cormorant flew, black and long-necked across
the water.</p>

<p>Some half-hour or so Corin sat there, basking
and dreaming in the sun, thinking, you may be
pretty certain, of nothing, or at all events with
thoughts too diffused to be worthy of the name.</p>

<p>And then, all at once, the antics of two birds
roused him to sudden interest. Gulls, he would
have called them, yet assuredly their manners were
perplexing. Winging rapidly for a moment or so,
they dropped suddenly like stones to the water.
Up again, they repeated the manœuvre, and
again, and yet again.</p>

<p>“Now what,” remarked Corin aloud, addressing
the apparent solitude, “do those things call themselves?”</p>

<p>“They,” said a voice behind him, “are gannets.”</p>

<p>Corin turned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">CONCERNING AN ARGUMENT</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Seated</span> on a rock, some half-dozen yards or so in
his rear, was David Delancey, calmly gazing out to
sea.</p>

<p>“How long have you been there?” demanded
an astonished Corin.</p>

<p>“Oh, twenty minutes or thereabouts,” returned
David. He got up from the rock and came to
seat himself nearer Corin. “I thought you were
dozing.”</p>

<p>“I was wide awake,” returned Corin with some
dignity.</p>

<p>It is not certain whether the imputation of
sleepiness had hurt his susceptible feelings, or
whether it was merely irritation at finding himself
observed when he thought himself alone, at all
events there was the faintest trace of asperity
in his manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>David regarded him perplexed. The slight
asperity was obvious. But what on earth had
caused it?</p>

<p>And then, whatever the cause, Corin felt a
trifle ashamed.</p>

<p>“But what,” he demanded, waving his hand
seawards, “are the mad things up to? What
possible pleasure or profit can they find in tumbling
head first into the water? If it weren’t,”
concluded Corin solemnly, “that I conceive them
to be brainless, I should imagine that they would
be suffering by now from violent headaches.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” responded David laughing, “they are
just diving.”</p>

<p>“Just diving?” echoed Corin. “But why from
such a height? Why don’t they get lower to the
water, first, if they want to dive?”</p>

<p>“Ask me another,” said David, smiling lazily.
“I suppose it’s habit, nature, whatever you like
to call it.”</p>

<p>Corin shook his head, as who should say, given
a free hand he’d instil vastly better habits. Aloud
he said:</p>

<p>“This is an extraordinarily pleasant spot.”</p>

<p>“It’s so jolly lonely,” said David musingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>“Therein,” remarked Corin, “lies one of its
greatest attractions.” And he quoted softly,
“Il y a toujours dans le monde quelque chose de
trop&mdash;l’homme.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded David bluntly.</p>

<p>Corin obligingly translated.</p>

<p>“Humph!” Obviously David demurred at this
statement. “I don’t altogether see what would
be the good of the world being pleasant if there
weren’t someone to enjoy it.”</p>

<p>“There would be,” said Corin, still softly,
“always oneself.”</p>

<p>David’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>“I guess a world run for one individual alone
would prove a bit over isolated,” he remarked
dryly. “Also, the question of which individual
might crop up.”</p>

<p>Corin sighed. The man was really a little too
literal. He shifted his ground.</p>

<p>“If,” he said didactically, “men lived together
in harmony, the soul would not crave for isolation.”</p>

<p>Had John been present, it is probable that ribald
laughter had greeted this remark. He knew these
moods. David did not.</p>

<p>“That’s true enough,” he responded gravely,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>“but who is to set the keynote? where’s your conductor
of the band?”</p>

<p>“If,” said Corin, addressing himself to the
sparkling water, “each man lived to the highest
within him, there would be no need for any
conductor.”</p>

<p>David frowned. He granted the high-soundingness
of the statement, you may be sure, but somehow
it did not strike him as altogether practical.
He fell back on his band simile.</p>

<p>“A fellow,” he remarked, “may fancy he’s got a
jolly good tune to play, and go at it for all he’s
worth, but if it doesn’t fit in with the rest, it stands
to reason a jumble will follow. If you could get
hold of the right conductor, I fancy you’d do a
precious deal better by playing second fiddle, or
even by striking a note on a triangle every now
and then, than by rattling off the best tune ever
invented on your own.”</p>

<p>“My dear man,” cried Corin eagerly, “your
theory is sound enough in a way; but if a man
really lives to the highest in him, he’ll merely
strike notes on a triangle if that’s his job.”</p>

<p>David shook his head.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” he said deliberately, “but there’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>always human nature to reckon with, and there’s
a good bit of difference between a man thinking a
thing the highest, and it being the highest. You
set out to do a thing thinking it’s the right thing
to do, and when you get a good clinch on it, I’m
blamed if you don’t begin to wonder if it was your
job after all.”</p>

<p>Again Corin sighed, and with an almost aggressive
patience.</p>

<p>“If you have honestly believed it to be the right
thing to do,” he remarked carefully, “it is the
right thing to do. Shakespeare never made a truer
statement than when he said, ‘There’s nothing
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.’
There’s the sum of all religion.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said David dryly, “religion is a mighty
elusive thing to tackle. There are some Indians&mdash;I
forget which brand their religion is&mdash;think it right
to treat the poor little widows as scum on the face
of the earth, but I don’t fancy any amount of
thinking can make it right to treat any woman that
way. There’s injustice somewhere if that’s the
way to deal with them.”</p>

<p>“It’s karma,” said Corin succinctly.</p>

<p>David pitched a pebble seawards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve heard you use that word before,” he
remarked, “but for the life of me I don’t know
what you’re driving at.”</p>

<p>Here was Corin’s chance. You may be sure he
jumped at it. I’ve vowed I’ll not follow his meditative
flights in this direction, but I fear me I’ll be
bound to transcribe his speeches.</p>

<p>“Karma,” quoth he, “shows us clearly the
justice of the whole of the so-called injustice of the
world.”</p>

<p>David grinned.</p>

<p>“It’s not what you might call a little subject,”
he remarked.</p>

<p>“Yet,” retorted Corin, “it is simplicity itself. No
evil suffered by man, woman, or child is undeserved.
It is suffered as punishment for sin committed.”</p>

<p>David looked down towards the sea.</p>

<p>“A baby can’t sin,” he said quietly, “yet I’ve
seen some poor little beggars mishandled in a way
that would make your blood boil.”</p>

<p>Corin shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I’ll allow that there are brutes in the world,”
he admitted, “but there’s no undeserved suffering.
What such a child suffered, it suffered for sins
committed in a past life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>David turned an amazed face upon him.</p>

<p>“Past life!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Corin calmly. “How do
you interpret such suffering if it isn’t inflicted for
sins committed in a past life? Wouldn’t it be horrible
injustice otherwise? You don’t, I suppose,
imagine the Powers above to be unjust?”</p>

<p>“No,” said David simply. “I’ve never gone
as far as that.”</p>

<p>“Then how on earth are you going to explain the
apparent injustice of the world?” cried Corin.
“Can’t you see that it apparently reeks with
injustice?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, yes! I see that fast enough,”
said David grimly.</p>

<p>“Then how do you explain it?” demanded
Corin.</p>

<p>“I’ve never tried to,” said David quietly.</p>

<p>“But, good heavens, man, what’s your intellect
given you for if you don’t use it?” almost shouted
Corin. “Why, if I couldn’t see some plan in what
the Powers above had arranged, I’d have chucked
up the sponge long ago.”</p>

<p>David looked silently towards the far-off horizon.
There was a queer little smile on his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Corin.</p>

<p>David turned.</p>

<p>“I guess,” he said slowly, “you’d think a soldier
a mighty poor sort of fellow who chucked up
fighting because he didn’t understand the plans
of his general. I guess God isn’t going to give
each of us a special interview, and explain His
plan of campaign, any more than a general is going
to call each private to his tent and explain his
before he sends him into battle. Of course if you
figure out a plan in your own mind, and fight
thinking it’s the right one, it’s a precious deal
better than chucking up the sponge, but all the
same, if you’re stuck on your own plan, you may
go beyond your job by a long chalk, and it’s best
to leave plans to your general. The only thing
that matters is to get your orders clear, and with
the muddle around you that’s not over easy.
Anyhow, I don’t find it over easy.”</p>

<p>“But,” remarked Corin coolly, “if, as you maintain,
no private is supposed to understand his
general’s plan, and he is not to follow his
own judgment, from whom is he to receive
orders?”</p>

<p>“Officers,” returned David promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>Corin snorted. It was not exactly an ill-bred
snort, you understand; nevertheless it was one.</p>

<p>“And will you kindly tell me where those
officers are to be found?” he questioned loftily.
“Look here, man, let’s drop simile for the moment.
If you maintain that we human beings are incapable
of understanding the plans of the Powers
that be, how are we going to shape the course of
our actions? We’ve got to work on some scheme,
if we don’t drift. Who’s going to interpret
that scheme to us, if we don’t interpret it for
ourselves?”</p>

<p>“That,” returned David, “is exactly what
I’m trying to figure out.”</p>

<p>Corin looked at him commiseratingly.</p>

<p>“My dear man,” he said gently, “you’ll find
that your figuring will bring you to but one conclusion.
You’ve got to interpret for yourself.
If you go off to ask other people, what will you
find? Every man will tell you that his way is the
right way. A Calvinist will talk of predestination,
a Congregationalist will talk of conversion,
a Catholic will tell you to go and confess your sins
to a priest, and a member of the established
Church of England&mdash;well, the Lord only knows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>what he’ll tell you. It’ll be a toss-up on the
special species you light on.”</p>

<p>“But,” said David firmly, “there must be truth
somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Of course there is,” returned Corin magnificently.
“There’s a modicum of truth in every
religion. Divest them of their forms and you’ll
get vastly nearer the whole truth. I tell you,
there’s the Divine in every man. The various
churches have set up God as a kind of bogey
wherewith to frighten naughty children. God
exists, but not separate from us, as the churches
teach, a judge to allot punishment or reward to
a feeble humanity; He exists in each one of us.
Each one of us is an actual part of the Divine, and
thereby is his own arbitrator, ruler, and judge.
And, that being so, it is absurd to imagine that we
are incapable of understanding the Divine plan.
Of course we understand it. To believe, to know,
that, is merely common-sense.”</p>

<p>David was silent.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” urged Corin.</p>

<p>David turned towards him.</p>

<p>“Well, if you really want my opinion,” he said
slowly, “I’m blamed if I don’t call it merely pride.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>Corin stared.</p>

<p>“Well, of all the&mdash;” he began.</p>

<p>He got no further. Where was the use of arguing
with a man who voluntarily padlocked his
intellect within an iron box, so to speak. It would
be mere waste of breath, a futile expenditure of his
energies. Yet, so reflected Corin, he had thought
so much better of him. Ah, well, the advance
guard of a movement cannot expect to have the
ruck too closely in his wake. It is only when the
path through superstition has been laid fair and
open, that one can expect the common herd to
follow.</p>

<p>“You’re a very young soul,” he said indulgently.</p>

<p>David gazed imperturbably out to sea.</p>

<span class="smaller">A DUMB DOG&mdash;</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Of</span> course there had been nothing out of the way
about the meeting, nothing particularly extraordinary
about the conversation, for all that Corin,
in spite of terming the matter simple, was convinced
of its depth. Yet, in some inexplicable
way, it was a momentous meeting to David. And
the kernel of the whole thing lay, neither in what
Corin had said, nor in what he had said, but
somehow in his own unspoken thoughts during
the conversation.</p>

<p>I don’t believe he could have put the actual
thoughts into words. He could not even formulate
them very distinctly in his own mind, but all the
same there had been a curious crystallizing process
going on within him. Little half-formed thoughts,
tiny almost insignificant incidents of the past ten
days, had drawn together with a strange magnetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>attraction into a concrete whole, though he was
not, even now, fully aware what that concrete
whole represented to him.</p>

<p>But there it was, a tangible, definite something
awaiting explanation. He could handle it now,
so to speak, without knowing to what purpose
it was to be put; it was massed together, where
formerly it had been mere particles, each too minute
and separate to be caught and fingered. Yet,
lying where it did, in the inmost recesses of his
soul, the question was whether he could ever bring
it sufficiently to the surface to show it to another,
and he believed that, without some external aid,
he would never arrive at its full significance.</p>

<p>Those who possess the gift of words are truly
to be envied. With a few brief sentences they
are able to elicit sympathy, criticism, judgment,
understanding, whatever their need may be.
The dumb dog is helpless. At the best, he has but
a few stammering phrases to his tongue, perhaps
but an inarticulate word or two, often no word
at all.</p>

<p>You can’t blame his fellow mortals if they fail to
understand his need: it is given to few to interpret
the language of the mute.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> came into the garden of the Green
Man the morning following the aforementioned
conversation, with determination in her heart,
and her formula on her lips.</p>

<p>She saw David sitting on a wooden bench near
the stream. He had left the parlour some ten
minutes previously.</p>

<p>He was looking at the running water. Even
at the distance he was from her, Elizabeth was
aware of a certain tenseness, a certain keyedness
in his attitude. He seemed waiting, expectant.</p>

<p>She went across the grass towards him, her
step making no sound on the soft turf. She was
within a couple of yards from him before he saw
her. He got up from the bench.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Darcy,” he said in a queer hesitating
voice, “if I can, I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth noticed that he did not say, “If I may.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI<br />
<span class="smaller">AT SOME LENGTH</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> sat down on the bench beside him.
Her whole demeanour said as plainly as speech:</p>

<p>“Take your own time. I have nothing on
earth to do but listen to you. Nothing will give
me greater pleasure. This is what I have been
wanting.”</p>

<p>It is astonishing what confidence such an attitude
will give. Confidences&mdash;hesitating confidences,
at all events&mdash;will take flight before the
least trace of urgency. If you think you’ve got to
be in a hurry to show them, they hide like shy
children in the inmost recesses of your soul, and
no amount of coaxing will bring them forth to
the light of day. You may, by dint of violent
effort, force them forth, so to speak; but, coming
unwillingly, they show no trace of their true
personality. You barely recognize them yourself;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>a stranger will not recognize them at all, unless he
be the one in a million endowed with an almost
uncanny gift of insight. And such a one, to my
thinking, will never hurry confidences.</p>

<p>“Do you mind my smoking?” asked David.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” returned Elizabeth cheerily.</p>

<p>David pulled pipe and tobacco pouch from his
pocket. Busy with them, he spoke.</p>

<p>“I am a bad hand at talking,” said he. “Words
are slippery kind of things, and slide out of my
mind as soon as I think I’ve got them fixed there;
so, if I talk in a muddle, perhaps you’ll forgive
me. I can’t even get what I want to say very
clearly to myself.”</p>

<p>He paused to light his pipe. Then went on:</p>

<p>“I fancy I’ll have to talk a bit in kind of symbols.
I see things that way myself better than in actual
descriptive words. You know, of course, my reason
for being here?”</p>

<p>“I do,” responded Elizabeth.</p>

<p>David was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said presently, pulling at his pipe,
“when I set out on this job, I didn’t think much
about the right or wrong of it. It was simply
there. It got up and stood before me suddenly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>and I said to myself, That’s what I’m going for.
I went for it. There’s no need to go into details.
It wasn’t an easy undertaking, but I brought it
through. What I set out to get is mine. It’s there.
I’ve only got to put out my hand and take it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Elizabeth, as he stopped.</p>

<p>“Well,” said David frowning, “now comes the
difficult part to put into words. What I’m going
to say may sound rubbish; but, for the life of
me, I don’t think it is. I’m going to get to symbols
now. Can you figure to yourself a man
finding a mighty powerful telescope; and, looking
through it, he sees a sack of gold lying in a place
some thousands of miles away, and he knows
that the sack is his for the seeking. Well, he
doesn’t think much about the wisdom of the
search, or its difficulties, or what he’s going to
do with the gold when he gets it. He just knows
it’s there, and it’s his if he can get to it. It isn’t
easy to find, and there are other people who think
they’ve got the right to it. But anyhow he gets
there, and establishes his claim. He’s got nothing
to do now, but put in his hand and take everything
that is in the sack. It seems simple enough,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>“It does,” said Elizabeth smiling. The naïveté
of his words amused her.</p>

<p>“But,” went on David, “just as he’s waiting
to take possession of the whole thing, he suddenly
gets a glimpse of something else, a bit further on.
Now, he doesn’t for the life of him know exactly
what it is, or what use he’s going to make of it,
only there’s some kind of voice telling him all the
time that it’s worth going for. That’s pretty
nearly all he knows about it. Common-sense
seems to say to him, ‘Empty your sack first,
and then go on and have a look.’ But way back
in his mind he has three thoughts,&mdash;one is that
he hasn’t any darned use for the gold in the sack,
he doesn’t know what to make of it&mdash;you remember
I’m speaking in symbols; the second is
that somehow it will be a bother carrying it along
with him on this other quest; and the third is a
queer sort of idea as to whether the gold is really
his after all. Of course everybody tells him it is.
Even the folk, who originally had the handling
of it, are bound to say it must be, and yet he
doesn’t feel dead sure. Do you see what I’m
driving at?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” he demanded, “what does it all mean?”</p>

<p>For a moment Elizabeth was silent.</p>

<p>“Can’t you tell me a little more?” she suggested.
“Haven’t you the smallest idea what this other
quest is?”</p>

<p>David hesitated.</p>

<p>“Not an atom clearly,” he said slowly, “at
least&mdash;” he stopped.</p>

<p>Again there was a silence. There was no
sound but the rippling of the water, and the
humming of insects. Occasionally a dragon-fly
darted across the surface of the stream with a
flash of silver wings. Beyond the grassy slope of
the fields opposite them stood the trees of the wood,
dark green, deep shadows lying beneath them.</p>

<p>And in the silence Elizabeth waited.</p>

<p>Presently David began to speak, shyly, difficultly.</p>

<p>“When I was a very little chap, I used to read
Tennyson. Do you know the bit,</p>

<p>Her words fell softly into the silence.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said David, his cheeks flushing.
“I used to care for that a lot,” he went on slowly.
“I used to play I was one of those knights going
in search. But it’s years since I’ve thought of
the poem, or had any of those fancies. Perhaps
working around knocks them out of one’s head.
Now, what I am going to say will sound pure
nonsense. One day, here, in a wood, the whole
thing came back to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Elizabeth gently.</p>

<p>“I came up through the wood to the edge of
the park,” said David, “and I found myself by
the Castle Chapel. A bell rang. I can’t in the
least explain what happened then, but I might
have been a little chap again, fancying myself
near the end of my quest, only it was about a
thousand times more real. Well, it’s just that.
What I played at as a little fellow has got hold of
me again.” He stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Elizabeth again, and very softly.</p>

<p>“I’ve tried to tell myself it’s nonsense,” went
on David, “but it’s no good. And it doesn’t
seem like play now. I can’t explain. Of course
reason tells me I’m being a bit mad, but the
thought has got hold of me and won’t let me go.
Mr. Elmore talked to me yesterday, down on
the beach. He talked what seemed to me a good
deal of rubbish, though I’ll grant it sounded all
right in one way. I told him what I thought
about it. But what we both said is beside the
matter. It’s just that all the time this idea was
gripping me tighter and tighter. It was as if
the quest was real. Everything&mdash;the sea, the
rocks, the birds, the sun, the wind&mdash;was telling
me so. I wanted to speak to someone about it.
Somehow I felt I could tell you. It seems so
real, and yet&mdash; What do you make of a fantastic
idea like that?” There was almost a wistful
note in his voice.</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s eyes were shining. Perhaps there
was the faintest hint of tears in them.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it is fantastic,” she said quietly.
“I&mdash;I know it isn’t.”</p>

<p>“You know it is real?” asked David wonderingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>“I know it is real,” she said. “There are
others who could tell you probably a great deal
better than I can; yet you’ve asked me, so I will
do my best. The story of King Arthur and his
knights seeking the Holy Grail, is a beautiful
story, a wonderful story. It was a marvellous
quest. It was the quest far the holiest purely
material thing that ever existed. And yet there
is Something more wonderful even than it, Something
always present upon the earth which may
be found by all who seek It. I think you have
been given a glimpse of that Quest.”</p>

<p>David looked at her silently.</p>

<p>Elizabeth drew in her breath.</p>

<p>“Christ in the Blessed Sacrament,” she said.</p>

<p>A silence fell on the words. Elizabeth’s heart
was beating quickly. David was looking at the
water.</p>

<p>“When the bell rang,” went on Elizabeth,
speaking simply, almost as she would have spoken
to a child, “it meant that Christ had come to the
altar within the chapel. He was lying there
as helpless as when He was nailed to the Cross.
It needs, perhaps, as great faith to see Him there,
under His white disguise, as it did to see God in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>the Man nailed to the tree of shame. Yet the
one stupendous marvel is as true as the other.
Up there, in the wood, you recognized the miracle,
without realizing what it was that you recognized.”</p>

<p>Once again fell silence. The wonder had been
spoken, the miracle, which day by day, at
countless altars, is silently performed, before
which the very angels themselves stand watching
in reverent awe.</p>

<p>It was a long time before David spoke again.
At last he said:</p>

<p>“Yet what bearing has&mdash;has <i>that</i> on the other
question,&mdash;the question of my accepting this inheritance?
Why do I imagine that my acceptance
might, in a measure, hinder this quest?
There are, by the way, quite a dozen ordinary
reasons which have cropped up to make me
dislike the thought of accepting. I’ll grant that
they are, no doubt, stupid reasons, which most
people would consider barely worth consideration,
but there they are. By themselves I might face
them fairly, weigh them, and come to a decision;
but added to them, all the time, has been this
other thought. Now the point is,” went on
David, leaning forward, and speaking with frowning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
deliberation, in the effort to make his meaning
clear, “which is really influencing me? Am I
making this queer thought the pretext for wanting
to be rid of the whole business, when it’s really
that I shirk the thought of the restrictions this
new mode of life must bring? Or is the thought
of these restrictions merely a side issue, which
should be ignored while I figure out the other
question? And, from every reasonable standpoint,
it hasn’t the smallest bearing on the case.
It seems absurd to suppose that it has. Then
there’s the third idea that I mentioned, the idea
that the whole thing is a mistake, and that I
haven’t any right to the place at all. But that
can really be ruled out; there’s so much proof to
the contrary. It’s odd to me to analyse like this;
and yet, for the life of me, I can’t help doing
it.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth listened, turned the matter in her
mind, and spoke.</p>

<p>“Let’s get hold of the business from a purely
reasonable and sensible standpoint first,” quoth
she. “You’ve made a bid for this inheritance
which you believed to be yours. It is proved,
from a legal point of view, that it is yours. Now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>tell me what you think of it,&mdash;from the merely
sensible standpoint, remember.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t one,” laughed David. “At least,
I don’t believe any one would dream of calling
it sensible. But we’ll call it the material standpoint.
The fact is that I’m not in the least dead
sure that I want the thing now. It would mean
a mode of life entirely foreign to me. I should
feel cramped and caged.”</p>

<p>“Well?” smiled Elizabeth triumphantly.</p>

<p>His statement so entirely coincided with her
own and Mrs. Trimwell’s views. Also Mrs.
Trimwell’s exceeding simple solution of the problem
was before her mind.</p>

<p>“Well,” echoed David, “naturally the simple
solution of the difficulty would be to chuck the
whole thing.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” nodded Elizabeth, delightedly, encouragingly.</p>

<p>“But,” continued David, “there’s another side
to the matter. Supposing I marry&mdash; I don’t
feel drawn to marriage I own,&mdash;but supposing I
do, supposing I have a son, won’t he possibly
turn on me? Won’t he ask what earthly right I
had to renounce what wasn’t mine alone, but which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>belonged to him as well? Won’t he ask why on
earth I raked up the whole business if I was going
to funk it in the end? Won’t he say, ‘You made
a fight for a thing which was yours and mine.
You got it. If it had been yours alone you would
have had every right to chuck it up. But it
wasn’t. You had no right to throw away what
belonged to me.’”</p>

<p>Elizabeth was dumb. Truly had this aspect
of affairs not dawned upon her. For a minute,
for two minutes, she was faced with a new problem.
Then suddenly, eagerly, she sprang at its solution.</p>

<p>“Legally,” she announced, “in strict justice,
the inheritance may be yours. In equity I don’t
believe it is at all.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked David.</p>

<p>“The whole thing,” said Elizabeth firmly,
“turned on that missing document. Those old
letters&mdash;my brother has told me about them&mdash;proved
that there had been such a document.
From the legal point of view those letters were
worthless, but only from the legal point of view.
Taking them into consideration, you could renounce
the property at once with a clear conscience.
Indeed,” pursued Elizabeth judicially,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>“if you want to act from the merely conscientious
point of view, disregarding the strict legality of
the matter, it would be, to my mind, the only
thing to do.”</p>

<p>David gazed at her.</p>

<p>“I never thought of those letters,” he said
slowly.</p>

<p>“Never thought of them!” cried Elizabeth.
“Why they were the crux of the whole business,
the only standpoint the present owners had to
work from.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see that now you’ve said it,” replied
David. “But, honest injun, I’ve only just seen
it clearly. Perhaps you will hardly believe me,
but it’s true. I left the details of the affair to
the solicitors. I began to get a bit sick of the
job after I’d got hold of the clues. I gave them all
I’d collected, and told them to bring the matter
through. I knew of the letters, of course, but
somehow never thought of the point of view you’ve
put forward. It seems incredible, but I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“I can quite believe that,” said Elizabeth
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Oh, she understood fast enough. She could
understand the nature that went hot-foot to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>vital issue, disregarding side lights on it, not from
callousness, but merely because they sank into
insignificance before the one big thought.</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded David.</p>

<p>“Oh,” smiled Elizabeth, “are you asking me
to be judge? Well, at all events, you must be
jury. If I sum up, you’ve got to weigh the case
and give the casting vote, remember.”</p>

<p>She stopped, collecting her thoughts.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said after a minute, “you’ll allow
that now you are seeing matters from a different
standpoint. You could&mdash;at least you think you
could&mdash;say to this imaginary son of yours: ‘My
dear boy, legally I had the possession in my
hands. Morally there was sufficient ground for
me to give it up if I chose.’ You see I am not
driving home the moral necessity of renouncement.
I am leaving a choice.”</p>

<p>“I see,” smiled David.</p>

<p>“Well,” pursued Elizabeth, “given the freedom
in that choice, we find the matter a trifle less
complicated. Let’s deal first with the purely
sensible side. Could you get used to the restrictions
you fancy the possession would entail?
Is the possession worth it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span></p>

<p>“In a measure it is,” said David, answering
the last question first. “It isn’t the title, or the
place for the grandeur of the thing. It’s the linking
up with the past. <i>That</i> holds me,&mdash;the oldness
of it. I suppose, too, I <i>could</i> get used to the
restrictions in time.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Elizabeth slowly, “now we come
to the more subtle aspect of affairs. You’ve
an idea that the possession may hinder you in
your quest. You must grant the quest real.
I <i>know</i> it is. Now, I can’t see the smallest reason
why it should prevent you actually finding what
you seek. It couldn’t. But I fancy,” went on
Elizabeth thoughtfully, “that there may be two
reasons for that idea of yours. The first, and
most obvious, seems that there is probably a
bigger moral obligation to give up the possession
than appears on the surface of things, in fact
that the possession <i>isn’t</i> yours, and that this queer
idea is a sort of inner voice telling you so. The
other reason&mdash;well, that’s only an idea of mine.
You can leave it at the first reason.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you tell me the second reason?”
demanded David.</p>

<p>“Because it isn’t a reason,” said Elizabeth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>“At least it isn’t properly one. It’s an idea.
And&mdash;well, anyhow I couldn’t exactly explain
it to you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed David. “Well then, it
comes to this,&mdash;legally the thing is mine. Morally
even, I’m not <i>bound</i> to give it up&mdash;we’ve allowed
that, remember,&mdash;but weighing against it is a
quite absurd feeling that I’d better give it up.
I’m putting aside mere material inclinations.
That sums up the case, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It does,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>David knocked the ashes from his pipe.</p>

<p>“What would you do?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” protested Elizabeth, “that isn’t fair.
You’re trying to shift the rôles. Your summing
up is merely a repetition of mine. I refuse to
act as jury, and pronounce the verdict.”</p>

<p>“The jury always talk the matter over,” said
David aggrievedly. “There’s never a jury of
one man.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth sighed.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” she said resignedly.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it seem an absurd thing to do&mdash;to
give it up?” queried David.</p>

<p>“Y-yes,” she hesitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>“Wouldn’t any one say I was pretty mad to do
it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“The world would,” said Elizabeth loftily.</p>

<p>“Well, we live in it,” announced David calmly.
“Doesn’t the reason for giving it up appear far-fetched?”</p>

<p>“To those who don’t understand,” allowed
Elizabeth. She was feeling rather disappointed
at his arguments.</p>

<p>“Then the common-sense point of view would
be to hang on to it?” argued David.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” agreed Elizabeth depressed.</p>

<p>“I am glad you agree with me,” reflected
David.</p>

<p>“But I don’t,” protested Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Oh!” David raised amazed eyebrows.
“You’ve agreed to everything I’ve said.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Elizabeth. “I can’t help it.
It’s true. It is common-sense. And yet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well?” queried David.</p>

<p>“Oh,” sighed Elizabeth, “where’s the use of
arguing the matter if you feel like that about it.”</p>

<p>“Only I don’t.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I don’t <i>feel</i> like that at all,” announced David
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>calmly. “The points of view I’ve put forward
express the workings of my intellect, not my
feelings.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” queried Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“And on the whole I prefer my feelings.”</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“That I’m going to give up the whole thing.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked at him.</p>

<p>He really was rather an amazing young man.</p>

<p>And then the door in the house behind them
opened. Elizabeth turned.</p>

<p>“Why!” said she surprised. “It’s Father
Maloney.”</p>

<p>He came quickly across the grass. It was
obvious that something was amiss.</p>

<p>“Forgive me for troubling you,” he began
breathlessly. “I have come to ask your help.
Antony is lost.”</p>

<p>“Antony!” exclaimed David and Elizabeth
in one breath.</p>

<p>Half a dozen words from Father Maloney
sufficed as explanation; half a dozen more from
the two promised all possible aid.</p>

<p>Father Maloney returned to the Castle. David
and Elizabeth set off on the search.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII<br />
<span class="smaller">A QUESTION OF IMPORTANCE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">That</span> which is frequently termed coincidence is,
as everyone knows, seldom an isolated event;
it is the fact that two or more events, neither of
them, perhaps, of any precise and definite importance,
occur simultaneously, each event having
some particular bearing on the other. If the
events should chance to be more than two, the
coincidence is termed extraordinary; and if they
should chance to be several, and, also, individually
of some importance&mdash;well, then I pity the man who
narrates them to an unsympathetic audience.
If he isn’t branded a liar out and out, he will, at
least, be thought to be possessed of an imagination
which is first cousin to one. If he isn’t despised,
he will be pitied,&mdash;pitied, too, with a patronizing
commiseration which will make his blood boil.
Asseveration of the truth of his statement will be
worse than useless. It will merely call forth a
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>smile, a kindly condescending smile, which says
plainer than spoken words:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we know you <i>believe</i> it to be true.
But these things <i>don’t</i> happen.”</p>

<p>And if, in the face of that exasperating smile
he should venture on protest, he will at once
receive the gently amazed reply:</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, I never said I doubted your
word.”</p>

<p>A reply which will leave him helpless, though
fuming.</p>

<p>Of course it is foolish to care. Truth is truth,
and there’s the end on’t. But he does care. He
knows his statement has been marvellous, incredulous;
he knows, too, that he has probably been a
fool to mention it. But having done so, he wants
belief. The man who will remark with inner
conviction, “Truth is stranger than fiction,” would
be a godsend to him at the moment. But the
man who will say that of another’s narrative
is a <i>rara avis</i>. He reserves it as the Amen to his
own.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of knowing all this, it is my lot to
narrate certain extraordinary coincidences in the
forthcoming pages. Therefore I can only trust
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>that my audience will be a trifle less incredulous
than the majority of audiences. Perhaps if it
weren’t for one of the events, which certainly
smacks of the miraculous, I might have more hope.</p>

<p>However, to proceed.</p>

<p>You have been given one event in the preceding
chapter.</p>

<p>The second concerns Antony.</p>

<p>It was the nursemaid who did the mischief,
since, in one sense, it must certainly be termed
mischief. It all arose from an ill-advised remark.
Possibly exasperation caused it. We’ll give her
the benefit of the doubt. It is true that Biddy
being, at the moment, a victim to severe toothache,
extra work had been laid on Louisa’s shoulders.
Had Biddy been present, you may be very sure
that the remark had not been made.</p>

<p>Antony had taken the loss of his title calmly.
This was hardly surprising. After all, it made
extraordinarily little difference. It was seldom
that he heard it, and then only from the lips of
comparative strangers. “The little master,” was
infinitely more familiar to him, and there was
still no earthly reason for changing that mode of
address. The prospect of a new home was also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>taken philosophically; there was, indeed, a certain
amount of excitement about it.</p>

<p>But one Friday morning&mdash;to be accurate, it was
the very morning of the somewhat momentous
conversation recently referred to&mdash;further enquiry
entered his mind.</p>

<p>“If I aren’t Sir Antony, what are I?” he
demanded of a busy nursemaid.</p>

<p>“Nobody particular,” replied Louisa, who,
hunting for some mislaid article, had no mind to
give to problems.</p>

<p>Antony demurred.</p>

<p>“I must be somebody,” he argued.</p>

<p>“Everybody is somebody,” retorted Louisa,
“but it don’t mean they’re anybody of importance.”</p>

<p>Antony pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>“What’s importance?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Bless the child!” cried Louisa, “why, you was
important when you was Sir Antony. Now
you’re of no more account than a beggar boy.”</p>

<p>Antony flushed. Resentment rose hot within
his soul.</p>

<p>“I aren’t a beggar boy,” he announced with
dignity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>“Precious like one,” muttered Louisa, rummaging
in a drawer.</p>

<p>Antony planted himself squarely in front of her.</p>

<p>“Louisa, I aren’t a beggar boy. Say I aren’t
a beggar boy.”</p>

<p>Now at that precise moment Louisa ran a pin
into her finger. It must be confessed that it was a
painful prick.</p>

<p>“You are a beggar boy,” she retorted, her
finger to her mouth. “Nothing but a beggar
boy.” The tone of the concluding words verged
on the malicious. Then she bounced out of the
room to seek elsewhere for what she had lost.</p>

<p>Antony walked over to the window.</p>

<p>His face was flushed, and his eyes were troubled;
indeed there was a suspicion of moisture about
them. He felt a distinct uneasiness at the statement.
The only modicum of comfort lay in the
fact that it had certainly been prompted by ill-temper.
Yet even that fact brought but small
assurance with it. Two or three experiences had
shown him that crossness occasionally urged
truth to the fore, when kindness would shield you
from its unpleasantness.</p>

<p>Memory, stirring uneasily, awoke.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span></p>
<p>There was the time when Buffey died. Buffey
was the Irish terrier. At first he had been merely
told that Buffey had gone away. Continual, and
perhaps over-persistent questioning, had elicited
the fact of Buffey’s demise. Biddy had been
cross when she told him, and she was sorry afterwards.
But, still, it had been the truth. No
subsequent regret could alter that fact. Possibly
this was the truth now.</p>

<p>From possibility, the thing became a certainty.
He remembered glances at him, whispers&mdash;unnoticed
at the time&mdash;of “poor little Antony”;
conversations checked at his approach. They
came back to him now, not fully, but vaguely,
holding significance. Probably Granny couldn’t
prevent this any more than she could prevent
Buffey dying. And she had told him she couldn’t
help that.</p>

<p>He began to experience a strange terror.</p>

<p>There is no dread as terrible as the dread a child
suffers at the hint of some unknown calamity.
He feels it must strike, but does not know at which
moment, nor from which quarter the blow will
fall. In most childish sufferings there is always
a certain consolation in the knowledge of protection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
by some older person. But when there is
reason to suppose that these natural protectors
are powerless to aid, terror indeed presses hard.</p>

<p>It pressed hard on Antony now.</p>

<p>The room seemed too small to hold it. Blindly
he turned from the window, ran stumbling from the
nursery, down the stairs, and out into the garden.
He ran past the flower beds, and the sun-dial, and
the close-clipped yew hedges, till he found himself
in a small paddock. There he sat down under
the hedge and began to review the situation.</p>

<p>A beggar boy!</p>

<p>He had no precise understanding of what the
words meant, nevertheless he fancied they were
closely akin to the description of Hans Anderson’s
little match girl, who warmed her blue fingers at
the matches till she died. The story was at once
fascinating and terrifying. Aunt Rosamund had
read it to him only once. After the one reading
she had suggested the Little Tin Soldier,
Thumbelina, or the Ugly Duckling. Nevertheless
the story had remained with him.</p>

<p>Rags, cold, and burnt matches, and finally
dying! His lips quivered, and tears came into his
eyes.</p>

<span class="smaller">MOLLY ARRANGES AFFAIRS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">“Hullo</span>!” said a voice.</p>

<p>Antony turned.</p>

<p>Molly’s dark head appeared above the bushes
behind him.</p>

<p>“What are you crying for?” demanded Molly.</p>

<p>“I aren’t crying,” said Antony. And we may
hope that the Recording Angel turned a deaf ear.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;” began Molly. But, after all, she
was tactful. “I ’spect it’s just the sun in your
eyes,” she remarked airily.</p>

<p>“It’s&mdash;it’s very sunny,” said Antony blinking.</p>

<p>Molly continued to look at him over the hedge.
He looked at Molly.</p>

<p>And then Antony took a resolve. Perhaps
instinct told him that a burden shared is a burden
half-lightened.</p>

<p>“I’m a beggar boy,” he announced succinctly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span></p>

<p>“A beggar boy!” shrilled Molly. She was
frankly amazed.</p>

<p>Antony nodded. He was experiencing a kind of
gloomy joy at her astonishment.</p>

<p>Molly gazed at him. Then:</p>

<p>“Indeed you’re not at all,” she snorted incredulously.</p>

<p>“I am,” said Antony, gloomily cheerful.</p>

<p>Molly cogitated, puzzled. Then her fertile
imagination leaped to the solution. Of course it
was make-believe!</p>

<p>“What fun,” cried she, on a top note of pleasure.
“But what are you sitting there for if you are?
Beggars go along the roads and beg.”</p>

<p>Antony looked alarmed.</p>

<p>“Oh, but perhaps I needn’t <i>begin</i> just yet,” he
protested.</p>

<p>“Why not!” cried Molly. You may be sure
that she saw herself assisting in the rôle. “It’s
a lovely day. Let’s start off at once.”</p>

<p>Antony had qualms of conscience. It was
forbidden to go beyond the grounds.</p>

<p>“P’raps Granny wouldn’t like it,” he demurred.
“P’raps I’d better ask her first. I think I haven’t
got to be one this d’rectly minute, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span></p>

<p>Again Molly was frankly puzzled.</p>

<p>Then, once more, her brow cleared. She saw
in the matter, though vaguely, some threat of
possible punishment for misdemeanours. But
here, assuredly, was actual opportunity to hand.
It was too good to be let slip.</p>

<p>“Indeed, never mind,” she urged. “If they’ll
be making you into a beggar any time, let’s just be
beggars now, to show them we like it. We do like
it,” she concluded, loftily magnificent.</p>

<p>“But,” argued Antony, “it won’t be nice to be
a beggar.”</p>

<p>“Nice!” echoed Molly ecstatic. “Nice! why
’twill be real beautiful, it will. We’ll go in bare
feet, and we’ll eat blackberries,&mdash;there’s a few
ripe already,&mdash;and we’ll get apples from the
orchards. Sure, it’s flint-hearted they’d be,”
cried she on a note pathetic, “if they’d begrudge
the bite of an apple to two hungry children. And
we’ll be sleeping under a haystack, and we’ll
paddle in the river, and&mdash;oh, we’ll have fine times,
we will that.”</p>

<p>The river won the day.</p>

<p>Have you, I wonder, the faintest conception of
its allurement? Can you see the water, clear as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>amber, rippling past mossy stones, feel its delicious
freshness against bare feet, hear the gurgling
music of its voice? Can you see the dragon-flies
skimming its surface, the ragged-robin massed
on its banks, the rushes standing proud and spearlike
at its edge?</p>

<p>Anyhow Antony could.</p>

<p>He saw it all at a glance,&mdash;an irresistible, alluring
prospect. He got up from the ground. After
all, he would not be alone.</p>

<p>“Come down to the gate,” said Molly, her eyes
gleaming. And then she slithered back into the
field.</p>

<p>Going across the field two minutes later, she
spoke.</p>

<p>“After we’ve paddled, we’ll walk to Stoneway,
and beg along the road.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Antony, but without much
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Anyhow there was the river first.</p>

<span class="smaller">AN ODD SENSATION</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is, of course, impossible for a small boy to
disappear from the face of the earth without a good
deal of uneasiness being felt regarding his disappearance. </p>

<p>By midday the uneasiness had approached to
something like alarm. The gardens, the paddocks,
the park, had been searched unavailingly; inquiry
had been made of every villager. No clue was
forthcoming; no possible reason for the disappearance.</p>

<p>A conscience-stricken Louisa kept a discreet
silence on the matter. There was, to her mind,
no occasion to incriminate herself unnecessarily.
The cause could afford no solution of the effect;
or, at any rate she told herself it could not, which,
after all, came to the same thing as far as her
silence was concerned.</p>

<p>A distraught Rosamund finally made swift way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>to the White Cottage, there to seek aid from
John.</p>

<p>Father Maloney went off to the Green Man to
find David. He saw the scouting propensities
he conceived men of his type to possess, standing
them in good stead at the moment. Having
enlisted his services, and likewise those of Elizabeth,
as already seen, he set off once again for the
Castle.</p>

<p>The day was as hot as the previous days had
been. The earth lay panting and breathless.
There was something almost ominous about the
brazen blueness of the sky, the extraordinary
stillness that hung over the earth.</p>

<p>Father Maloney, breasting the hill, wondered
vaguely whether the world would ever again
breathe in comfort. Personally he considered
asphyxiation a not remote possibility.</p>

<p>And then, all at once, he became aware of a subtle
change in the atmosphere. It wasn’t that the
sky was less blue, or the air less heavy, or the sun
less brilliant. And, having said what it was not,
I find myself at a loss to say what it was. It lay
more in a curious foreboding, a certain indefinable
prescience of change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span></p>

<p>“I believe,” said Father Maloney, addressing
himself to the sky, “that we are going to have a
storm.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE OAK FALLS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">An</span> hour later he was certain of the fact.</p>

<p>Sitting in the hall with Lady Mary he saw
the clouds covering the sky. Black, ominous, they
rolled swiftly up, blown, it would appear, before
a strong wind. Down below the air was breathless.
There was a curious feeling of suspense
in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>“There’s going to be a heavy storm,” said Lady
Mary, following the direction of his eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m thinking there’ll be a&mdash;” he began.
And then he stopped. A heavy rumble had broken
the stillness.</p>

<p>“It’s coming,” said Lady Mary. And she got
up, crossing to the window.</p>

<p>“Glory be to God!” muttered Father Maloney
watching her.</p>

<p>Once more came the growl, like the low roar of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>some angry beast. There was a pause. And then
in one sudden flash the gloom of the hall was
turned to a blinding white light, a light appalling,
terrible. It was followed by a thunderous crash,
a crash that shook the whole place, echoing and
reverberating in the distance.</p>

<p>Lady Mary turned a white face from the
window.</p>

<p>Then came a sound of steps in the gallery overhead,
the steps descended the stairs. Biddy appeared,
white and shaking.</p>

<p>“My Lady,” she stammered, “’tis the great oak
is struck. I saw it fall from the nursery window.
And the child&mdash;” She broke off. Her face was
working.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, tut,” said Father Maloney.</p>

<span class="smaller">TOLD IN THE STORM</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">“The</span> storm,” said John, “will be upon us in a
moment.”</p>

<p>Rosamund had found him by the gate of the
White Cottage. Half a dozen words had put the
happening before him. Two minutes had sufficed
to inform Mrs. Trimwell that his return might be
delayed. Three minutes saw him again beside
Rosamund.</p>

<p>With no earthly clue to guide them, with north,
south, east, west, to choose from, it was, so it
seemed, a pure toss-up which route they should
pursue.</p>

<p>After a moment’s consultation they set out for
the willows and the river, deciding to take their
way down stream. It was no less unlikely than
any other road, though it certainly cannot be
termed more likely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>Conversation, you may well believe, was non-existent;
eyes and ears alert, they pursued their
way. Hope at first held some sway in their hearts,
but an hour’s fruitless walking brought it to a low
ebb.</p>

<p>“I think we had better turn back,” said Rosamund.
“He would never have come further than
this.”</p>

<p>It was then that John made the aforementioned
remark.</p>

<p>“The storm will be upon us in a moment.”</p>

<p>As he spoke came the first low growl of thunder;
a moment later a louder, deeper growl. A gust of
wind swept the river, bending the rushes, breaking
the still surface of the water into a thousand moving
fragments. Then two or three big raindrops fell.</p>

<p>John glanced round quickly. Some three hundred
yards lower down the river was a rough shed,
a thing built of logs, and roofed with corrugated
iron. Possibly it was used as a shelter for the
men who cut the willows, which abounded in the
sedgey meadows.</p>

<p>“Quick,” he cried indicating it. And they set
off at a run.</p>

<p>They weren’t a moment too soon. They had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>barely reached it, when the sky, seen through the
opening of the shed, became a sea of white light,
through which tore a blinding zig-zag, a veritable
river of fire; a reverberating crash broke above
them. And then the rain came down. It fell
like bullets on the iron roof of the shed, deafening,
terrifying. The wind tore with insensate fury
at the wooden walls, rushed through the opening
in a swirl of madness, lashing the rain before it.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tony!” cried Rosamund. And she hid
her face in her hands.</p>

<p>John saw the gesture, though the words were
lost in the deafening noise around them.</p>

<p>Wisdom, prudence, waiting, fled out into the
storm, escaped on the wings of the gale.</p>

<p>He caught her hands in his.</p>

<p>What he said was as lost as her own cry. But,
after all, perhaps there was no need to hear the
words.</p>

<span class="smaller">AFTER THE RAIN</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">“It</span> really was a providential storm,” said John.</p>

<p>The clouds had broken; the rain, though still
falling, was descending in a silver shower, sparkling
in sunlight. The wind had sunk to a cool fresh
breeze.</p>

<p>“Providential!” Rosamund raised amazed eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Providential,” echoed John firmly. “You
are thinking of Antony, who is by this time, I
trust, safely returned to the bosom of his family, or
at all events in some shelter as friendly as ours.
I am thinking of the courage the storm brought in
its wake.”</p>

<p>“Oh?” she queried.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t,” said John pathetically, “pretend
that you don’t understand me. Explanations
would be painful. I should stand confessed
as a coward of the deepest dye.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span></p>

<p>“Nonsense,” she smiled. And then she looked
towards the opening of the shed. “Come,” she
laughed; “the rain has nearly stopped.”</p>

<p>They came out into the open.</p>

<p>“The country,” said John, “has had its face
washed, and is thankful.” Then he pointed to the
northeast. “Look,” he said, “our benediction!”</p>

<p>A double-arched rainbow stretched across the
sky, brilliant, luminous, backgrounded by the retreating
clouds. They paused, to look. Scientists
may find excellent explanations of this wonder;
but to some, at least, it will ever stand for what it
has stood through age-old centuries&mdash;the symbol
of hope.</p>

<p>John might have remained gazing indefinitely,
or, at all events, until the brilliant arc had faded
had not Rosamund brought him to a remembrance
of things present.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said. “Antony.”</p>

<p>John turned.</p>

<p>“The rogue!” he laughed. “But, all the same,
I am enormously in his debt.”</p>

<p>They made their way back along the river bank.
Eyes were still alert, ears open to any sound. But
there was no longer the same anxiety, the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>foreboding. Doubtless the storm had been, in a
measure, responsible for both. Physical conditions
have a way of intermingling themselves so
closely with mental conceptions, that you are
really at a loss to separate the two. Indeed, you
don’t attempt to separate them; you don’t perceive
the physical conditions as existent, you perceive
only the mental conceptions. Hence arises depression,
that slate-grey state of the soul, in which
the mind puts on black spectacles, and through
them views the world in general, and its friends
in particular.</p>

<p>Now, with the fresh breeze fanning their faces,
with the world around them emerald green, silver,
blue, and gold, with, above all, declared love
singing joyously in their hearts, the two viewed
the prospect through the most rose-coloured spectacles
imaginable. Tragedy, even the remotest
hint of tragedy, seemed unthinkable, impossible.</p>

<p>Doubtless you, also, will be of their way of
thinking.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLVIII">CHAPTER XLVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">IN SEARCH</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Strictly</span> speaking the discovery of the truant
was due to Mrs. Trimwell. David and Elizabeth
were merely her agents in the matter.</p>

<p>It came about in this way.</p>

<p>They had set off hot-foot on the search. Passing
the White Cottage, they had seen Mrs. Trimwell
at the garden gate. She greeted their approach
with eagerness. It was obvious that she had
certain information to impart, information which
she considered of the first importance. Therefore,
with politely restrained impatience, they paused
to hear it.</p>

<p>“Them two,” she announced, with a faint
trace of injury in her voice, and meaning John
and Rosamund, “was gone before I could as much
as get a word in edgeways, else I’d have given
them a notion on the matter. You mark my words
there ain’t never no mischiefness nor troublesomeness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
afoot but what Molly Biddulph ain’t at the
bottom of it. Find Molly and you’ll be finding
the little master.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth smiled patiently.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” she remarked, “but, without wishing
to be pessimistic, I really cannot see that it
will be in the smallest degree easier to find Molly
than to find Master Antony.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell looked at her pityingly.</p>

<p>“Bless you, ma’am, I wasn’t going to give you a
notion what was that jumbled there wasn’t no
end to take hold of to unwind it by, so to speak.
It’s little use a notion of that sort would be. I see
Molly going by here about half-past seven or
thereabouts, with a tin can, a brown paper parcel,
a willow stick with a bit of string to it, and saying
her prayers out of a morsel of a book.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” queried Elizabeth; while David looked
his doubts. For the life of them they could see
no connection between Molly passing the cottage
at that hour, and any possible clue to the matter
on hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trimwell smiled oracularly. She perceived
their doubts well enough.</p>

<p>“The little book,” quoth she “meant that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>Molly was off to Mass. I ain’t known Molly
from babyhood for nothing. The parcel meant
as she was taking her dinner with her, being
off on the spree like for the day. The tin and the
willow stick means fishing in the river. Not that
she ever catches anything as I knows on.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Elizabeth. She was beginning to
see light. David laughed.</p>

<p>“Like as not she’ll have happened on the little
master,” announced Mrs. Trimwell, “and took
him along with her. Leastways I for one don’t
believe he’s ever gone off on his own account.
You try the river, and up the river, mind. I see
Miss Rosamund and Mr. Mortimer going off
down the river. ’Tis too wide and open there
for Molly. She’ll go for the shallower parts up
to Hurst Lea Woods, I’ll be bound.”</p>

<p>Here at least was something to go on, some
conceivable possibility. Nay, to Elizabeth’s mind,
and to David’s mind, it began to present itself
in the light of a probability. At all events for
present purposes it might be desirable to regard
it as such.</p>

<p>“You go to Hurst Lea Woods,” nodded Mrs.
Trimwell emphatically once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span></p>

<p>“We will,” agreed David briefly.</p>

<p>A moment later they were on their way.</p>

<p>Taking their route first through the village,
they presently turned sharply to the right, past a
smith’s forge, where a big cart horse was being
newly shod, and down a lane. Here, again to the
right, they came upon a stile set in a blackberry
hedge. Surmounting it, they found themselves
in a meadow, while facing them, blue and hazy in
the distance lay Hurst Lea Woods. So far, at
least, their course was clear.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour’s walking brought them
to the river, and the woods on its opposite bank.
To the left lay the moorland which it skirted;
to the right lay meadows through which it flowed;
and, some mile or so distant, the high road between
Malford and Whortley. Here the river passed
beneath a stone bridge, again seeking the meadows,
through which it made a great bend southwards.
Bending again to the left along its meadow route,
it finally, with another southward bend, emptied
itself into the sea, at a small village some five
miles to the east of Malford.</p>

<p>Here, below the woods, it ran amber-coloured
and shallow, brown stones cropping up above its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>surface. Rushes and ferns bordered it; ragged-robin
grew in great pink patches in the meadows
lying along its southern bank. On its northern
bank were the woods stretching upwards, dark,
shadowed, mysterious.</p>

<p>Elizabeth and David came to a simultaneous
halt, and looked around.</p>

<p>“Apparently,” remarked Elizabeth, “they are
not here.”</p>

<p>The remark seemed somewhat over-obvious.</p>

<p>David went across the short grass to the
very margin of the river, and looked right and
left.</p>

<p>“It would seem,” said he smiling, “that you
are right.”</p>

<p>All around lay the drowsy summer silence,
broken only by the faint humming of insects,
and the ripple of water against the stones.</p>

<p>“What,” demanded Elizabeth, “is the next
move?”</p>

<p>“Up stream,” said David promptly.</p>

<p>“Why so certain?” asked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>David looked at her with something of the
smile one might give to an inquiring child.</p>

<p>“Will you,” he said, “look down stream, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>then look up stream; and I fancy you will perceive
the answer yourself.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth looked down stream.</p>

<p>Here, as already mentioned, the river ran
smoothly, bordered by the flat meadow and the
wood. Some hundred yards distant the wood
gave place to grass land, flat and open. Up
stream the ground became uneven, rough, covered
with blackberry bushes and small trees. The
river itself was interspersed with little rocks,
while sight of it extended not more than fifty
yards ahead.</p>

<p>“You mean that up stream there are possible
surprises,” suggested Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Precisely,” said David. “No one, man,
woman, or child, turns to the obvious when there
is the unknown to explore, possible adventure
ahead.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth laughed.</p>

<p>“I bow to your judgment,” said she.</p>

<p>They turned up stream.</p>

<p>It was rough enough walking here. The river
lay in a sort of gorge, the wood on one side, the
moorland on the other. A mere track ran along
its right bank, a narrow grass path. There was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>no sign of footprints. The grass was short and
springy, taking no definite impress on its
surface.</p>

<p>David was obviously the leader of the expedition.
He had taken complete control of it, not
masterfully, you understand, but merely because
it belonged to him by right to do so. He was in
his natural element.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was conscious of totally new characteristics
in him. All trace of the child in false
surroundings had vanished. The man element
had appeared in him, and had appeared strongly.
There was a new strength in him, a new decision.
There was a curious air of confidence about him,
also a certain indefinable joyousness. It seemed
an almost incredible change, considering the brief
space of time in which it had been accomplished,
nevertheless it was actual, real.</p>

<p>For the most part they pursued their way in
silence. The sky, as you may well guess, was
gradually growing darker. Clouds had already
blotted out the sun.</p>

<p>Suddenly David gave a little exclamation.
He bent to the ground, and picked up something
from beneath a blackberry bush. He turned it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>over, then held it triumphantly towards Elizabeth.
After all, it was only a piece of brown paper.</p>

<p>“But,” demurred Elizabeth, “is it <i>the</i> piece?”</p>

<p>David pointed to writing upon it.</p>

<p>“Mr. Murphy Biddulph, Malford,” read Elizabeth
aloud. And then she laughed.</p>

<p>David lifted up his voice and coo-ed, a long,
far-reaching note. Striking some distant rock,
it was flung back to him in echo, but no other
cry came in response.</p>

<p>“They’ve gone a pretty tramp,” said David.</p>

<p>He looked around. A short distance ahead
the wood levelled and thinned. A gateway into
it led to a wider path. A tree-trunk fallen across
the river, which here was nothing but a fair-sized
stream, made approach to the gate easy. David
made for the tree-trunk. Giving Elizabeth a hand
across it, they went towards the gate.</p>

<p>David looked at the ground, then pointed
silently. A dark patch on the earth, just under
the gate, showed where water had been recently
spilt.</p>

<p>“Molly has upset some of the contents of her
can in climbing the gate,” laughed David.</p>

<p>There was triumph in his eyes. There is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>good deal of pleasure to be found in successful
scouting, let alone the importance, or non-importance
of its issue.</p>

<p>They surmounted the gate and made off down
the path. After some five minutes or so walking,
it led to a second gate, this one giving on to a road.
David opened it and they went through. Here,
in the dust, were small footprints, easily discernible
as going leftwards.</p>

<p>“Who would have dreamed of their coming this
distance!” exclaimed Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” quoth David succinctly,
“that from all accounts it is wiser to dream vividly
and extensively where Miss Molly Biddulph is
concerned.”</p>

<p>And they set off down the road.</p>

<p>They hadn’t gone more than a hundred paces,
when the first low mutter of thunder broke upon
their ears. There was a second rumble, louder,
more insistent. Then came the wind. It swept
the dust along the road in a cloud, thick and
blinding, and a few drops of rain fell.</p>

<p>The next instant the sky was transformed into
a sea of fire, and a crash like the crash of cannon-balls
broke above them. Then the rain came down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span></p>

<p>David caught hold of Elizabeth dragging her
beneath a hedge.</p>

<p>“Is it safe?” gasped Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“It would strike the trees first,” said David,
“and there are none on this side of the road.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth crouched down. The rain slashed
upon the roadway, churning the dust into a sea
of mud. To right and left all vision was blotted
out in the downpour, even the hedge opposite was
almost obliterated.</p>

<p>“Are you getting very wet?” asked David
solicitously.</p>

<p>“Hardly at all,” said Elizabeth cheerfully.
“This hedge seems specially constructed to give
shelter.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said David, “I am off in search.”</p>

<p>As he spoke there came the sound of pattering
feet on the road, and the next instant, abreast
them, came two flying, drenched, little figures,
the girl with white scared face, the boy frankly
sobbing aloud.</p>

<p>David darted towards them.</p>

<p>“Antony, Molly,” he cried.</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the two came to a halt.
Joy, rapturous joy, illumined their woe-begone faces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, it’s you,” cried Antony.</p>

<p>The next moment they were beneath the friendly
shelter of the hedge; while Molly, with a marvellously
rapid transition from depression to
confidence, was taking a lively interest in the
storm.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it splendid!” she cried exultantly. “Isn’t
the rain just hitting the earth!”</p>

<p>“It’s hit you pretty considerably, I fancy,”
said David coolly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll be drying,” responded Molly calmly.
“Is Master Antony wet?”</p>

<p>“You can hardly imagine him to be dry,”
remarked David. “If you stand under a shower-bath
you generally get a trifle damp. And this&mdash;I
guess fifty shower-baths would be nearer the
reckoning than one.”</p>

<p>“A million <i>I</i> think,” said Molly, snuggling
a wet hand through Elizabeth’s arm. “<i>Isn’t</i> it
lovely!”</p>

<p>“To speak candidly,” said Elizabeth, “I could
admire it better in a less cramped position, and
if the rain were a little, just a trifle, less&mdash;wet.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t rain,” demanded Antony interested,
“always wet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span></p>

<p>He was beginning to take a cheerier outlook on
life.</p>

<p>“I believe it is,” remarked David reflectively,
“but there are times when it appears infinitely
wetter than others. This is one of them. Are
you <i>very</i> wet?” he asked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” returned Elizabeth cheerfully,
“owing to the position I mentioned, I am
quite dry. If I were to relax it, however, I should
doubtless become excessively wet.”</p>

<p>“We are all like beggars now,” said Molly
gleefully.</p>

<p>David pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>“Beggars?” he queried politely.</p>

<p>Molly looked a trifle embarrassed. In a manner
of speaking she had given herself away.</p>

<p>“Well, we are,” she replied airily, after a moment.
“Sitting under hedges and things, you know.”</p>

<p>“It <i>isn’t</i> very nice,” said Antony.</p>

<p>“Nobody sensible could ever imagine it was,”
remarked Elizabeth. She fancied she saw a
glimmer of light on the escapade.</p>

<p>“Must it always be horrid?” asked Antony.
There was an ominous quaver in his voice.</p>

<p>“Always,” said Elizabeth firmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span></p>

<p>She had, you will realize, no intention of aiding a
repetition of today’s little drama.</p>

<p>David was watching Antony’s face.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Antony choked.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” urged David.</p>

<p>Antony was silent.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” coaxed David again.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I <i>are</i> a beggar,” owned Antony.</p>

<p>David laughed, a laugh at once incredulous
and consoling.</p>

<p>“Now who,” he demanded, “has been telling
you that nonsense?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it true?” asked Antony.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. Who on earth made you
think it was?”</p>

<p>“L-Louisa,” stammered Antony.</p>

<p>David said something under his breath.</p>

<p>“Tell us all about it,” he said consolingly.</p>

<p>Then the whole story came forth, aided in the
telling by a dexterous question or two.</p>

<p>“Idiot,” muttered David, arriving at the kernel
of the matter.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to be naughty,” said Antony
quaveringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span></p>

<p>“You weren’t naughty.” David’s voice was
assuring. “It was Louisa who didn’t understand.
You aren’t a beggar boy; you never were a beggar
boy. You are,” David’s voice was firm,
“exactly the same as you always have been.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s heart was singing a curiously joyful
song, considering what extraordinarily little difference
the announcement made to her individually.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said David again, “as you always
have been.”</p>

<p>“Deo gratias,” whispered Elizabeth below her
breath.</p>

<p>“And here,” said David, “comes the sun, to
laugh at you for your fears, and dry us all.”</p>

<p>The clouds had broken. Through the rifts
between them the sun poured forth, sparkling
on diamond-hung hedges and trees, turning the
pools in the roadway to little mirrors of fire. The
rain became the thinnest veil of silver, presently
mere scattered drops.</p>

<p>Elizabeth unbent herself, and stood upright.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” she said smiling, “if my back will
ever feel quite straight again.”</p>

<p>And then she pointed to the sky.</p>

<p>“Look,” said she, “the rainbow!”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FALLEN OAK</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Father Maloney</span> came down the steps of Delancey
Castle. News of the wanderers might by
this time have reached the village. With a view
to making inquiries, he had taken his departure.</p>

<p>The storm had passed; only leaves and twigs
scattered on the lawn, battered rose bushes,
marigolds beaten to the earth, showed what its
fury had been.</p>

<p>He turned into the park. As he came abreast
the great oak, he paused. Split from apex to
base it lay upon the ground, its branches strewn
for yards around,&mdash;the oldest tree in the park,
the king of centuries, a devastated wreck.</p>

<p>A lump rose in Father Maloney’s throat. He
was not given to superstitions, but I fancy he
saw an omen in the fallen monarch. Considering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>the happenings of the last few weeks, it was
hardly surprising.</p>

<p>He crossed the grass, picking his way among
the fallen branches, till he came to the very base
of the tree itself,&mdash;a jagged, deplorable stump, a
pitiable remnant.</p>

<p>“Sic transit gloria mundi,” he said sorrowfully.
And then he stopped.</p>

<p>“Glory be to God!” he ejaculated, and stood
staring at the débris before him.</p>

<p>It was some seconds before his brain began to
take in the possible significance of what he saw,
and even when the significance dawned on him,
it is certain that he did not grasp its probable
magnitude.</p>

<p>“Glory be to God!” he ejaculated again, and
bent towards the ground.</p>

<p>Two minutes later he was trotting, with vastly
more haste than dignity, once more in the direction
of the Castle, a small iron box tightly tucked under
his arm.</p>

<span class="smaller">A MIRACLE</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">“’Tis</span> a miracle! ’Tis nothing but a miracle!”
cried Father Maloney, for perhaps the fiftieth
time.</p>

<p>He stared at the yellow parchment upon the
table in front of him. It was real, it was tangible.
He could touch it, finger it, even read the crabbed
writing upon it; and yet, for the life of him, he
could hardly bring his brain to believe that he
was not dreaming.</p>

<p>“To think,” he ejaculated, “that it has lain
there under our very noses, so to speak, and us
wondering and worrying all these weeks. Well,
well!”</p>

<p>Lady Mary looked silently at the yellow parchment.
Words, so far, had failed her. The bigness
of the thing, gripping her, had held her silent.</p>

<p>“’Tis plain enough what the old Sir Antony
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>was up to, when Henry came upon him, the
scoundrel,” said Father Maloney. “And the
secret kept all these years! ’Tis a miracle has
brought it to light now.”</p>

<p>Lady Mary raised her head.</p>

<p>“And perhaps too late,” she said quietly,
voicing the fear at her heart; a fear which, with
the last hour, had been waxing stronger.</p>

<p>“Too late!” cried Father Maloney cheerily,
“not a bit of it. If it’s two miracles is needed,
God will be working them; though I’m thinking
there’ll be no miracle in bringing the boy home.
He’s hiding safe enough somewhere, and will be
found before sun-down, I’ll be bound.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Lady Mary very low, and
unheeding his words, “I didn’t give up everything
whole-heartedly. Perhaps I still held to it in
my mind. If I did, it was for him, and not for
myself. And now he is gone.”</p>

<p>“Rubbish,” said Father Maloney.</p>

<p>“Is it?” asked Lady Mary.</p>

<p>Father Maloney put his hands upon the table
and looked across at her.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you doing your best to accept God’s
will in the matter?” he demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span></p>

<p>Lady Mary smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“I believe so,” she said.</p>

<p>“Then if you did your best, you may be sure
God took it as such, and wasn’t holding you to
account for any little weakness which was but
part and parcel of human nature. I’m thinking
He knows the human side of us well enough, and
doesn’t look at it too closely when we’re trying
to do His will. He’ll not have been taking a
trifle of fretting into consideration, when your
heart was set the right way. You needn’t be
thinking He was waiting to pounce down and
punish you because you didn’t throw the Castle
over to that young fella with devil a bit may care
in your heart. Sure, it’s giving Him the things
the human side of us is fretting after that counts.
Don’t you go fearing God likes punishing people.
Where’s your faith at all?”</p>

<p>“But supposing&mdash;” began Lady Mary.</p>

<p>“I’m not supposing at all,” broke in Father
Maloney. “The child’s safe enough. And if
he isn’t&mdash;though surely ’tis in my heart he is&mdash;’tis
no punishment to you. Glory be to God!
Who do you think loves him best, our Blessed
Lord, or you? I tell you he’s as safe in His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>keeping, storm or no storm, as if he was in his
bed this very minute with you on one side of him,
and Biddy on the other. ’Tis all for talking about
the Love of Christ we are, and when it comes to
the test, it’s precious little believing we show.
And I’m as bad as any of ye.”</p>

<p>“Then you are anxious,” said Lady Mary
quietly.</p>

<p>Father Maloney blew his nose.</p>

<p>“Anxious! of course I’m anxious,” he said
half-testily. “Who wouldn’t be anxious with a
bit of a boy out in the weather we’ve had. ’Tis
against all sense I shouldn’t be anxious. But he’ll
come home right enough,” he ended obstinately.</p>

<p>And then suddenly the cloak of quiet dignity,
the gentle control, fell from Lady Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, Father,” she cried, “go on saying that.
Say it again and again. I don’t mind how often
you say it. Somehow,” her lips were trembling
piteously, “it makes it seem true.”</p>

<p>For the moment she was nothing but a frightened
old woman, fear gripping her close.</p>

<p>“There, there,” said Father Maloney soothingly
speaking as he would speak to a child, “aren’t I
understanding every bit of what you’re feeling.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>But remember you’ve got Michael, whatever
happens. And whatever happens is the very best
thing possible; though, for that matter, as I’ve
told ye&mdash;” He broke off, listening.</p>

<p>And then, through the open window, came the
sound of voices, Rosamund’s plainly distinguishable,
and a child laughing.</p>

<p>“Glory be to God!” cried Father Maloney,
the laugh finding triumphant echo in his voice.
“What did I tell you, at all!”</p>

<span class="smaller">AND SO THE STORY ENDS</span></h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">“And</span> that,” said David, concluding a little
speech, “is all.”</p>

<p>A curious silence fell upon the room. Rosamund
and John looked at each other; Lady Mary had
her hands folded over an old piece of parchment;
Elizabeth was watching her; Father Maloney
looked at David.</p>

<p>“You mean,” said Father Maloney, breaking
the silence, “that you wish to give up your claim
to the whole thing?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said David pleasantly.</p>

<p>“And what,” demanded Father Maloney, “has
brought you to this conclusion?”</p>

<p>“Simply,” said David smiling, “that I have
seen that fishes live best in water, as birds live
best on land. This,” he waved his hand around
the hall, “isn’t my element.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span></p>

<p>Lady Mary rose quietly from her chair, and
thrust something into a drawer of her desk.
Then she turned to David.</p>

<p>“Is that your sole reason?” she asked.</p>

<p>David coloured.</p>

<p>“For practical purposes,” he replied.</p>

<p>Lady Mary looked straight at him.</p>

<p>“In my grandson’s name,” she said, a little
smile trembling on her lips, “I accept your generous
offer in the spirit in which you make it.”</p>

<p>Father Maloney stared.</p>

<p>“Glory be to God!” he ejaculated inwardly,
“she doesn’t mean to tell him. She’s a wonderful
woman, is Lady Mary. A wonderful woman!”</p>

<p>And then suddenly a bell rang out, pulled by
the stalwart arm of the under gardener.</p>

<p>Father Maloney started.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul,” he cried, “’tis time for Benediction.”</p>

<p>And he bolted towards the dining-hall, which,
as I told you long ago led to the chapel.</p>

<p>Lady Mary looked at the little group.</p>

<p>“We’re all coming,” said Elizabeth with fine
assurance.</p>

<p>And then Lady Mary led the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span></p>

<p>Said John in a low voice to Rosamund:</p>

<p>“I have at least three thanksgivings to make.”</p>

<p>“I think,” she replied, looking at him, “that
so have I.”</p>

<p>Said David in a low voice to Elizabeth:</p>

<p>“What are you thinking about?”</p>

<p>“I am thinking,” quoth she smiling, “that
there is a folly which is very very wise.”</p>

<p>And then they all went in to Benediction.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">By Netta Syrett</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><i>12<sup>o</sup>. $1.35</i></p>

<p>Miss Syrett’s novel might be called <i>The
Making of a Modern Woman</i>. The story begins
in 1885, when Rose Cottingham, the heroine,
is nine years old. It shows us Rose first as
a child at war with her home environment,
then her life as a school girl, and then her
wider emotional and intellectual experiences
when she goes out into the world and mixes
in literary society. The book is not only a
subtle study of a girl’s development, but is
also a striking picture of the social and literary
life of the late Victorian period, the period of
<i>The Savoy</i> and <i>The Yellow Book</i>, of Oscar Wilde
and Aubrey Beardsley, of the æsthetic and
the earlier Socialist movements.</p>

<p>In this novel is told how, for the sake of a
girl, in pity for her grief, in blind obedience to
her entreaties, Aubrey Derrington, a possible
peer of the realm, the fastidious, bored, dilettante
man about town, whom his friends had
known only as such, finds himself not only in
love, but in as tight a corner as ever a man
was placed, with the risk of criminal prosecution
as an accessory after the fact. A love
story, full of charm, complexity, and daring,
is unfolded in the fresh gorse and heather-strewn
setting of the Devonshire moors and
against the dark background of frowning
prison walls. A girl, an innocent convict,
a wolf in sheep’s clothing, and the hero of the
story are the central figures.</p>

<p>A mediæval story in which romance, magic,
and a woman’s fascination are blended effectively.
The reader is introduced to Peregrine,
son of Nichol the Jester, who, after the death of
his father, succeeds to the motley. Nichol on
his deathbed unfolds the theory of the Jester’s
life. He has been a jester on the surface, but
a man inside, and counsels Peregrine to remember
that. The Lady Isabel, vain and greedy of
power, seeks to ensnare Peregrine. Isabel, who
has had dealings with a witch, casts her spell
upon Peregrine and provokes him to a jealous
brawl, in consequence of which he is dismissed
in disgrace. He spends some time in the castle
of a mediæval Circe; then, seeing the ideal
woman in a dream, he begins the quest of her,
a quest which, after many adventures and interesting
happenings, results in fulfillment.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
